The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019 2
Foreword
Since its inception in 2015, the 2030 Agenda has provided a blueprint
for shared prosperity in a sustainable world—a world where all people
can live productive, vibrant and peaceful lives on a healthy planet.
The year 2030 is just over a decade away, and we must ask ourselves
if our actions today are laying the right foundation to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Sustainable Development
Goals Report 2019 provides evidence-based insights to answer this
question.
The report demonstrates that progress is being made in some
critical areas, and that some favorable trends are evident. Extreme
poverty has declined considerably, the under-5 mortality rate fell
by 49 per cent between 2000 and 2017, immunizations have saved
millions of lives, and the vast majority of the world’s population now
has access to electricity. Countries are taking concrete actions to
protect our planet: marine protected areas have doubled since 2010;
countries are working concertedly to address illegal fishing; 186 parties
have ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, and almost all
have communicated their first nationally determined contributions.
About 150 countries have developed national policies to respond to the
challenges of rapid urbanization, and 71 countries and the European
Union now have more than 300 policies and instruments supporting
sustainable consumption and production. And a wide range of other
actors—international organizations, businesses, local authorities, the
scientific community and civil society—have engaged with the SDGs in
a manner that generates great hope for the coming decade. The United
Nations, for its part, is working hard to reposition to the United Nations
development system to be better equipped to meet the needs of
governments to respond to this integrated and transformative agenda.
Notwithstanding that progress, this report identifies many areas
that need urgent collective attention. The natural environment
is deteriorating at an alarming rate: sea levels are rising; ocean
acidification is accelerating; the past four years have been the
warmest on record; one million plant and animal species are at risk of
extinction; and land degradation continues unchecked. We are also
moving too slowly in our efforts to end human suffering and create
opportunity for all: our goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is being
jeopardized as we struggle to respond to entrenched deprivation,
violent conflicts and vulnerabilities to natural disasters. Global
hunger is on the rise, and at least half of the world’s population lacks
essential health services. More than half of the world’s children do
not meet standards in reading and mathematics; only 28 per cent of
persons with severe disabilities received cash benefits; and women
in all parts of the world continue to face structural disadvantages and
discrimination.
It is abundantly clear that a much deeper, faster and more ambitious
response is needed to unleash the social and economic transformation
needed to achieve our 2030 goals. From our advances, we know
what works. This report therefore highlights areas that can drive
progress across all 17 SDGs: financing; resilience; sustainable and
inclusive economies; more effective institutions; local action; better
use of data; and harnessing science, technology and innovation with a
greater focus on digital transformation. In everything we do, we must
diligently ensure that policy choices leave no one behind, and that
national efforts are supported by effective international cooperation,
grounded in a commitment to diplomacy and crisis prevention.
The SDG Summit, the Climate Action Summit and the other crucial
meetings that will take place in New York in September 2019 provide
leaders everywhere with an opportunity to get the world back on
track and to kick-start a decade of delivery for people and the planet.
The time is right, and we must act now. In that spirit, I commend this
report to a wide global audience.

3 Introduction
Introduction
Four years after signing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, countries have taken action to integrate the Goals and
targets into their national development plans and to align policies
and institutions behind them. The Sustainable Development Goals
Report 2019 uses the latest available data to track global progress
on the SDGs and to take stock of how far we have come in realizing
our commitments. The report shows that, while advances have been
made in some areas, monumental challenges remain. The evidence
and data spotlight areas that require urgent attention and more rapid
progress to realize the 2030 Agenda’s far-reaching vision.
Member States agree that these challenges and commitments are
interrelated and call for integrated solutions. It is therefore imperative
to take a holistic view of the 2030 Agenda and to identify the highest
impact areas in order to target interventions.
The most urgent area for action is climate change. If we do not
cut record-high greenhouse gas emissions now, global warming
is projected to reach 1.5°C in the coming decades. As we are
already seeing, the compounded effects will be catastrophic and
irreversible: increasing ocean acidification, coastal erosion, extreme
weather conditions, the frequency and severity of natural disasters,
continuing land degradation, loss of vital species and the collapse
of ecosystems. These effects, which will render many parts of the
globe uninhabitable, will affect the poor the most. They will put food
production at risk, leading to widespread food shortages and hunger,
and potentially displace up to 140 million people by 2050. The clock
for taking decisive actions on climate change is ticking.
The other defining issue of our time is increasing inequality among
and within countries. Poverty, hunger and disease continue to be
concentrated in the poorest and most vulnerable groups of people
and countries. Over 90 per cent of maternal deaths occur in low- and
middle-income countries. Three quarters of all stunted children live in
Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. People living in fragile States
are twice as likely to lack basic sanitation, and about four times as
likely to lack basic drinking water services as people in non-fragile
situations. Youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than
adults. Women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid
domestic work and lack autonomy in decision-making.
Just as problems are interrelated, the solutions to poverty, inequality,
climate change and other global challenges are also interlinked.
Valuable opportunities exist to accelerate progress by examining
interlinkages across Goals. For example, tackling climate change
requires a shift to clean energy, reversing the trend in forest loss,
and changing our production and consumption patterns. Promoting
sustainable agriculture can help reduce both hunger and poverty,
since close to 80 per cent of those who are extremely poor live in rural
areas. Increasing access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene
can save millions of lives per year and improve school attendance.
Improving proficiency in reading and mathematics of some 200
million children who are falling behind in sub-Saharan Africa will help
them climb out of poverty and ultimately enable the region to better
compete in the global marketplace.
This report also highlights the importance of investing in data for
the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Most countries do not
regularly collect data for more than half of the global indicators. The
lack of accurate and timely data on many marginalized groups and
individuals makes them “invisible” and exacerbates their vulnerability.
While considerable effort has been made to address these data
gaps over the past four years, progress has been limited. Increased
investment is urgently needed to ensure that adequate data are
available to inform decision-making on all aspects of the 2030
Agenda. Towards that end, the Dubai Declaration, launched at the
second World Data Forum in October 2018, outlines a demand-driven
funding mechanism under Member States’ oversight that will respond
quickly and efficiently to the priorities of national statistical systems.
The challenges highlighted in this report are global problems that
require global solutions. No country or individual can resolve them in
isolation. In other words, multilateral action is more important than
ever. Remarkably, we have already seen how the 2030 Agenda has
brought disparate groups together to work towards common goals.
International cooperation on climate change, migration, technology,
trade and partnerships with all stakeholders can be strengthened even
further with the facilitation of the United Nations system. There is still
time for us to achieve the SDGs if we act now and act together, taking
advantage of the many synergies that exist across the 2030 Agenda.

End poverty in all its
forms everywhere
The decline of extreme poverty continues, but the pace has slowed,
and the world is not on track to achieving the target of ending poverty
by 2030. Extreme poverty today is concentrated and overwhelmingly
affects rural populations. Increasingly, it is exacerbated by violent
conflicts and climate change. Tackling the remaining pockets of
extreme poverty will be challenging due to their persistence and
complexity—often involving the interplay of social, political and
economic factors. Effective social protection schemes and policies,
along with government spending on key services, can help those left
behind get back on their feet and find a way out of poverty.
Progress against poverty continues but has slowed, jeopardizing achievement of the Goal
The share of the world’s population living in extreme poverty
decreased to 10 per cent in 2015, from 16 per cent in 2010 and
36 per cent in 1990. More than one billion people have lifted
themselves out of poverty over the past 25 years. Much of this
progress was in Eastern Asia, where the poverty rate fell from
52 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2010 to less than 1 per cent in
2015. More recently, Southern Asia has made impressive inroads
against extreme poverty, helping to reduce the global rate further.
However, the pace of change is decelerating. The nowcast shows the
2018 rate of extreme poverty at 8.6 per cent, and baseline projections
suggest that 6 per cent of the world’s population will still be living in
extreme poverty in 2030, if current trends continue.
Extreme poverty remains stubbornly high in low-income countries and
countries affected by conflict and political upheaval, particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa. Among the 736 million people who lived on less
than $1.90 a day in 2015, 413 million were in sub-Saharan Africa. This
figure has been climbing in recent years and is higher than the number
of poor people in the rest of the world combined.

Forecasts suggest that without significant shifts in policy, extreme
poverty will still be in the double digits in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.
About 79 per cent of the world’s poor live in rural areas. The poverty
rate in rural areas is 17.2 per cent—more than three times higher than
in urban areas (5.3 per cent). Close to half (46 per cent) of extremely
poor people are children under 14 years of age.
More than one third of employed workers in sub-Saharan Africa still live on less than $1.90 a day
Having a job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent
of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme
poverty in 2018, despite a rapid decline in the working poverty rate
over the past 25 years. Substandard working conditions are the
main issue, underscoring the central role that decent and productive
employment plays in helping people escape poverty.
Progress in reducing working poverty has slowed over the past five
years, suggesting that efforts in this area need to be reinvigorated. The
situation remains particularly alarming in sub-Saharan Africa, where the
share of working poor stood at 38 per cent in 2018. In least developed
and landlocked developing countries, at least one quarter of workers
live in extreme poverty despite having a job. Employed young people
(between 15 and 24 years of age) are more likely to be living in poverty,
with a working poverty rate that is double that of adult workers. 0 10 20 30 40 50

23 Goal 1 | No poverty
Social protection systems fall short of reaching the world’s most vulnerable people, including children
Social protection programmes reduce the brunt of poverty and can also
prevent people from falling into poverty in the first place. By helping
to prevent and ease poverty and inequality at every stage of people’s
lives, such programmes make societies more inclusive and stable.
However, only 45 per cent of the world’s population are effectively
covered by at least one social protection cash benefit. The remaining
55 per cent—as many as 4 billion people—have been left behind.
The extent of coverage depends on the type of protection system
and the region. Globally, 68 per cent of people above retirement age
receive a pension, but the benefits in many countries are often not
enough to lift older people out of poverty. Data also show a global
deficit of social protection for other groups: only 22 per cent of the
unemployed receive unemployment benefit payments, 28 per cent
of persons with severe disabilities receive disability cash benefits,
one third of children are effectively covered by social protection, and
only 41 per cent of women giving birth receive maternity cash benefits.
Furthermore, coverage of social assistance cash benefits is as low as
25 per cent for vulnerable groups—children, people of working age and
older persons not protected by contributory schemes.
The differences among regions are stark: 92 per cent of children
are covered by social protection systems in Europe and Northern
America, 56 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean, but only
13 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 14 per cent in Eastern and
South-Eastern Asia.

Children covered by social protection

Note: Data for Northern Africa and Western Asia, and Oceania (excluding Australia and New
Zealand) are not shown due to low population coverage of available data. Data on
children covered by social protection are not shown for Central and Southern Asia due
to low population coverage of this data for Southern Asia.
Poverty affects children disproportionately. One out of five children live
in extreme poverty, and the negative effects of poverty and deprivation
in the early years have ramifications that can last a lifetime. Ensuring
social protection for all children and other vulnerable groups is critical
for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly
in regions with large coverage gaps between children and other
segments of the population.
The toll of climate-related disasters is rising, with poorer countries most affected
No matter the measure—whether loss of life or economic loss—
disasters cause enormous suffering the world over. From 1998 to
2017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at
almost $3 trillion, of which climate-related disasters accounted for
77 per cent of the total (a rise of 151 per cent from 1978 to 1997).
Over that period, climate-related and geophysical disasters claimed
an estimated 1.3 million lives. More than 90 per cent of all disasters
were caused by floods, storms, droughts, heatwaves or other extreme
weather events.
Poverty is a major underlying driver of disaster risk, so it comes
as no surprise that the poorest countries are experiencing a
disproportionate share of damage and loss of life attributed to
disasters. More than 90 per cent of internationally reported deaths
due to disaster occur in low- and middle-income countries. Disasters
kill 130 people for every one million people in low-income countries
compared to 18 per one million in high-income countries. Economic
losses resulting from disasters are also much higher in poorer
countries, when measured as a percentage of their gross domestic
product (GDP). Among the 10 worst disasters in terms of economic
damage (when expressed relative to GDP), 8 occurred in low- or
middle-income countries.

Despite earlier extended progress, the number of people suffering
from hunger has been on the rise since 2014. Stunting affects the
growth and cognitive development of millions of children, while the
prevalence of overweight—the other face of malnutrition—
is increasing in all age groups. In the wake of conflicts, climateinduced shocks and economic slowdowns worldwide, intensified
efforts are needed to implement and scale up interventions to improve
access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all. Specifically,
attention needs to be given to increasing the agricultural productivity
and incomes of small-scale food producers, implementing resilient
agricultural practices, and ensuring the proper functioning of markets.
Finally, in ensuring that no one is left behind on the road towards zero
hunger, the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition must be broken.
After extended progress, the number of people suffering from hunger is on the rise
The number of people going hungry has increased since
2014—a worrisome trend. An estimated 821 million people were
undernourished in 2017, the same number as in 2010. The prevalence
of undernourishment has remained virtually unchanged in the past
three years at a level slightly below 11 per cent. Updated figures on
undernourishment, food insecurity and malnutrition will be released in
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019 (July 2019).
The situation deteriorated significantly in sub-Saharan Africa, where
the number of undernourished people increased from 195 million in
2014 to 237 million in 2017. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region
with the highest prevalence of hunger, with the rate increasing from
20.7 per cent in 2014 to 23.2 per cent in 2017. In South America, the
situation also appears to be worsening. This may be the result of an
economic slowdown, which reduced fiscal capacity to protect the
most vulnerable against rising domestic prices and loss of income.
Adverse weather conditions affecting food availability and prices, and
prolonged armed conflicts, are among the key drivers of these trends.
Stunting and wasting in children are declining, but not fast enough to meet SDG targets
Chronic undernutrition or stunting—defined as inadequate height
for age—puts children at an increased risk of dying from common
infections. Stunting is also associated with poor cognitive development,
which can have a negative impact on a country’s long-term progress.
Since 2000, the proportion of stunted children has been declining;
however, 149 million children under 5 years of age—22 per cent of
the global under-5 population—were still chronically undernourished
in 2018. Three quarters of those children live in Southern Asia
(39 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (36 per cent). More intensive
efforts are needed to meet the target of bringing the number of stunted
children down to 100 million by 2025 and 83 million by 2030.
In 2018, 49 million children under 5 years of age—7.3 per cent of the
global under-5 population—suffered from acute undernutrition, or
wasting (low weight for height), a condition generally caused by limited
nutrient intake and infection. Over half of children with wasting live in
Southern Asia. The global wasting rate in 2018 remained well above the
5 per cent global target for 2025 and the 3 per cent target for 2030.

The prevalence of overweight, another form of malnutrition, is increasing in all age groups
Childhood overweight and wasting form the double burden of
malnutrition. Children who are overweight or obese are at higher risk
of early-onset obesity-related health and psychological complications.
They often carry the extra weight into adolescence and adulthood,
leading to lifelong health problems. The prevalence of overweight is
increasing in all age groups. In 2018, childhood overweight affected
40 million children under 5 years of age—5.9 per cent of the global
under-5 population. Prevalence levels were above 9 per cent in
Northern Africa, Southern Africa, Central Asia, Oceania (excluding
Australia and New Zealand) and Western Asia.
Globally, in 2016, overweight affected 20.6 per cent of children 5 to 9
years old (131 million), 17.3 per cent of adolescents (207 million) and
38.9 per cent of adults (2 billion). The promotion of healthy diets is
central to halting and reversing the obesity epidemic. Governments
have a range of policy options to choose from to improve access to
healthy and affordable diets, from “hard” policies, such as bans and
regulations, to “soft” policies, that entail lower degrees of intervention
in people’s lives, such as the provision of information.
Small-scale food producers are a big part of the
solution to world hunger
Empowering small-scale food producers to participate fully in
development is critical to improving food security and reducing
poverty and hunger. Many small-scale and family farmers are poor;
have limited capacities and resources; face regular food insecurity;
and have limited access to markets and services. Both the income
and productivity of small-scale food producers are systematically
lower than those of their larger counterparts. The share of small-scale
producers among all food producers in countries with data in Africa,
Asia and Latin America ranges from 40 per cent to 85 per cent,
compared to less than 10 per cent in Europe. To strengthen the
resilience and adaptive capacity of small-scale producers, it is
important to help them improve their agricultural productivity.
Equally important is enabling them to manage their natural resources
sustainably; adapt to climate change; and overcome barriers in
accessing markets, financial services, information and knowledge.
Steeply climbing food prices affect countries across
several regions
Weather-induced shocks, civil insecurity and declining food
production have all contributed to high food prices in at least two
dozen countries worldwide. In 2018 and the first months of 2019,
production shortfalls, currency depreciations and insecurity triggered
high food prices in several countries in Africa. In Central America,
the price of maize climbed steeply in mid-2018, mainly over concerns
about the impact of severe dry weather on the main season’s crops.
The same occurred in some countries in East and Southern Africa in
the first months of 2019. Economic turmoil also drove up food prices
in some countries, while low public inventories and increased fuel
costs led to record high prices in others.
Support to the agriculture sector from domestic and foreign sources continues its downward trend
Investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger and
poverty, improving food security, creating employment and building
resilience to disasters and shocks. However, government spending on
agriculture in relation to its contribution to the economy fell between
2001 and 2017. At the global level, the agriculture orientation index
(AOI)—the share of government expenditure to agriculture divided
by the share of GDP from agriculture—fell from 0.42 in 2001 to
0.26 in 2017. From 2015 to 2017, the average AOI was highest in
Northern Africa and Western Asia (0.42) and lowest in sub-Saharan
Africa (0.20). Aid to agriculture is only a fraction of what it was
in the 1980s. The share of sector-allocable aid to agriculture from
member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell from
nearly 25 per cent in the mid-1980s to only 7 per cent in 2017—a total
of $12.6 billion.
The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019 26
Ensure healthy lives
and promote
well-being for all
at all ages
Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of
people. Maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced, life
expectancy continues to increase globally, and the fight against some
infectious diseases has made steady progress. In the case of other
diseases, however, progress has slowed or stalled, including global
efforts to eradicate malaria and tuberculosis. Far too many deaths
occurred because trained health workers or routine interventions,
such as immunizations, were not available. In fact, at least half the
world’s population, many of whom suffer financial hardship, are still
without access to essential health services. In rich and poor countries
alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty.
Concerted efforts are required on these and other fronts to achieve
universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health;
address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, including
mental health; and tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental
factors contributing to ill health, such as air pollution and the lack of
safely managed water and sanitation.
Sustained investment in maternal health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, is needed to meet the global target
Despite significant progress in maternal health, in 2017, nearly
300,000 women died from complications relating to pregnancy and
childbirth. Over 90 per cent of them lived in low- and middle-income
countries. For every woman who died, countless others suffered acute
and even lifelong consequences of maternal ill health.
The majority of maternal deaths are preventable through appropriate
management and care, including antenatal care by trained health
providers, assistance during delivery by skilled health personnel, and
care and support in the weeks after childbirth. However, progress
has slowed in recent years. Continued investment and attention
are needed to reach the global target of fewer than 70 maternal
deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030, which could save more than
one million lives over the course of a decade.
Ensuring that all births are assisted by skilled health professionals is
not only critical to reducing maternal morbidity and mortality, but also
to reducing stillbirths, morbidity and death among newborns. Based
on the latest data from 2013 to 2018, 81 per cent of all births globally
took place in the presence of skilled health personnel, a significant
increase from 69 per cent from 2006 to 2012. In sub-Saharan
Africa, where two thirds of the world’s maternal deaths occur, only
60 per cent of births were assisted by skilled attendants. Projections
show that substantially more resources will be required just to
maintain current coverage rates in Africa, due to population growth.
Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause
of death among adolescent girls in developing countries. The risk
is highest for girls under 15 years of age. Globally, the adolescent
fertility rate declined from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent girls in
2000 to 45 in 2015 and 44 in 2018. However, the adolescent fertility
rate remained high in sub-Saharan Africa at 101 births per 1,000
adolescent girls in 2018.

27 Goal 3 | Good health and well-being
If the SDG target for under-5 mortality is met, the lives of an additional 10 million children will be saved by 2030
Remarkable progress has been made in child survival worldwide,
and millions of children under 5 years of age are more likely to
survive today than in 2000. The under-5 mortality rate has fallen
by 49 per cent—from 77 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to
39 deaths in 2017. The total number of under-5 deaths dropped
from 9.8 million in 2000 to 5.4 million in 2017. Half of those deaths
occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, and another 30 per cent in Southern
Asia. Almost half (2.5 million) of the total number of under-5 deaths
took place in the first month of life—the most crucial period for
child survival. The global neonatal mortality rate fell from 31 deaths
per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 18 deaths in 2017—a 41-per cent
reduction.
Under-5 and neonatal mortality declined in all regions, with the fastest
progress in regions where levels were highest. Yet stark disparities
persist across regions and countries. In 2017, 118 countries already
had an under-5 mortality rate below the target of 25 deaths per 1,000
live births. However, progress will need to accelerate in about 50
countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, to meet the target by 2030.
If this is achieved, the lives of an additional 10 million children under
5 years of age will be saved. Many of these deaths could be prevented
through interventions such as vaccinations, exclusive breastfeeding,
proper nutrition, appropriate treatment of common childhood
infections, as well as reductions in air pollution and access to safely
managed drinking water and sanitation.
Despite broad immunization coverage, outbreaks of measles and diphtheria have resulted in many unnecessary
deaths
Immunization is widely recognized as one of the world’s most
successful and cost-effective health interventions, saving millions
of lives. In 2017, 116.2 million children were immunized, the highest
number ever reported. At the same time, pockets of low coverage
have led to outbreaks of measles and diphtheria, resulting in many
deaths—a clear demonstration of the importance of reaching full
coverage.
The proportion of children who have received the required three
doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3)-containing
vaccine increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015,
but remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. An estimated
19.9 million children did not receive the vaccine during the first year of
life, putting them at serious risk of potentially fatal diseases.
Two doses of the measles-containing vaccine are required to prevent
the disease and the illness, disability and death caused by associated
complications. Coverage by the second dose (MCV2), given during
the second year of a child’s life or upon school-entry age, increased
from 15 per cent in 2000 to 59 per cent in 2015 and 67 per cent in
2017. This progress, while dramatic, is still insufficient to prevent
measles outbreaks.
The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has the
potential to significantly reduce deaths in children under 5 years of
age. Globally, coverage by PCV has made steady advances since it
was introduced, but has yet to reach 50 per cent. Many countries,
including middle-income countries that have limited access to
international financial support, are lagging behind because their
current health budgets may not be sufficient to cover the costs
without external support.

The decrease in HIV incidence is falling short of the target, despite steady progress in sub-Saharan Africa
Strong domestic and international commitment and funding for
the AIDS response has fuelled an acceleration of evidenced-based
programmes for prevention, testing and treatment. As a result, the
incidence of HIV among adults (15 to 49 years of age) in sub-Saharan
Africa declined by around 37 per cent from 2010 to 2017. This
represents a drop from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in
2010 to 2.14 in 2017. Progress has been slower elsewhere, and some
subregions have even seen an increase in HIV incidence, including
Western Asia (53 per cent), Central Asia (51 per cent) and Europe
(22 per cent).
Global HIV incidence among adults declined by 22 per cent between
2010 and 2017, well short of the progress required to meet the 2020
and 2030 targets. The largest decline in incidence by age group was
among children 0 to 14 years old (37 per cent from 2010 to 2017),
reflecting increased provision of antiretroviral medications to prevent
mother-to-child HIV transmission.
With progress against malaria at a standstill, increased efforts are urgently needed in the most affected countries
After more than a decade of steady gains against malaria, progress
has stalled. No significant advances were made in reducing the
number of malaria cases worldwide from 2015 to 2017. The incidence
rate of malaria declined by 18 per cent between 2010 and 2015—
from 72 cases per 1,000 people at risk to 59 —and then remained
unchanged from 2015 to 2017.
In 2017, an estimated 219 million cases of malaria and 435,000
deaths from the disease were reported. Sub-Saharan Africa continues
to carry the heaviest burden, accounting for more than 90 per cent
of global malaria cases, and the toll is rising. From 2016 to 2017,
approximately 3.5 million more malaria cases were reported in the 10
most affected African countries. Children under 5 years of age are the
most vulnerable to the disease, and account for 61 per cent (266,000)
of malaria deaths worldwide. Funding for malaria had been increasing
since 2000, but recently stalled. Increased support directed to the
most affected countries is urgently needed.
Gaps in detection and treatment of tuberculosis,
along with drug-resistant strains, are pushing
progress against the disease off course
Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of poor health and death
worldwide. An estimated 10 million people fell ill with the disease
in 2017. It was the top killer from a single infectious agent that
year (above HIV) and the tenth leading cause of death overall.
Nevertheless, significant progress has been made. The incidence of
tuberculosis declined by 21 per cent since 2000—from 170 new and
relapsed cases per 100,000 people that year to 140 in 2015 and 134
in 2017. The tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people
fell by 42 per cent over the same period. However, large gaps in
detection and treatment persist, and the current pace of progress is
not fast enough to meet the target of ending the epidemic by 2030.
Moreover, drug-resistant tuberculosis is a continuing threat. In 2017,
there were 558,000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin, the most
effective first-line drug, of which 460,000 had multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis.
Neglected tropical diseases are slowly being
vanquished, but remain a scourge in poorer countries
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of
communicable diseases found in 149 tropical and subtropical
countries. They affect billions of people—particularly those who
live in poverty, lack adequate sanitation, and are in close contact
with infectious vectors and domestic animals—costing developing
economies billions of dollars each year. In 2017, 1.58 billion people
required mass or individual treatment and care for NTDs, down
from 1.63 billion in 2015 and 2.03 billion in 2010. At least one NTD
was eliminated in 34 countries in 2017. However, actual progress is
likely even stronger, since improved surveillance is identifying more
people requiring interventions against NTDs than in the past. In least
developed countries, 52 per cent of the population (522 million)
required treatment and care for NTDs in 2017, down from 78 per cent
in 2010. To effectively control and eliminate NTDs, current measures
must be intensified and expanded.

29 Goal 3 | Good health and well-being
Lapses in environmental health are increasingly recognized as major contributors to illness and death
Inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene is linked to 60 per cent
of the disease burden from diarrhoea, 100 per cent of the burden
from infection through soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms),
and 16 per cent of the burden owing to malnutrition (“burden” is
understood as being the impact of a health problem as measured by
financial cost, mortality, morbidity or other indicators). These three
conditions led to a total of 870,000 deaths in 2016. This large disease
burden could be significantly reduced if safely managed drinking
water and sanitation services were universally available, and good
hygiene practices were followed.
Both household and ambient air pollution increase the risk of
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and are major risk factors
for non-communicable diseases. Exposure to household air pollution,
mainly due to polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, led
to around 4 million deaths in 2016. Health risks from this type of
pollution are particularly high among women and children, who

typically spend the most time around the stove. Ambient air pollution
from traffic, industry, power-generation, waste-burning and residential
fuel combustion resulted in around 4.2 million deaths in 2016.
Health personnel are stretched beyond their limit in countries where they are needed most
Strengthening primary health care and achieving health for all requires
an adequate workforce that is motivated, supported and available
where needed. Sadly, this is far from the reality. Available data
from 2013 to 2018 indicate that close to 40 per cent of all countries
have fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people, and around
58 per cent of countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery
personnel per 10,000 people. This is only a slight improvement from
2010 to 2015.
Evidence shows that health workers are unevenly distributed across
the globe and even within countries. Not surprisingly, regions with
the highest burden of disease have the lowest proportion of health
workers to deliver services. All of the least developed countries have
fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people, and 98 per cent
have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000
people. It is estimated that around 18 million additional health workers
will be needed globally by 2030 to ensure healthy lives for all.
Countries have greater capacity to detect than to respond to public health emergencies
The International Health Regulations is a legally binding agreement
that requires countries to report certain disease outbreaks and
public health events to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Since 2010, all 196 States Parties have sent reports to WHO on their
capacity to implement the Regulations, and on their preparedness
to deal with health emergencies more generally. In 2018, 190 States
Parties submitted reports, compared to 167 in 2017.
An analysis of 182 reports shows that, globally, progress has been
made in all 13 of the Regulations’ core capacities. Almost all States
Parties are performing better in detection (e.g., surveillance and
laboratory detection) than in emergency preparedness and response.
Bigger gaps have been observed in capacity at points of entry (e.g.,
ports, airports and ground crossings) and in chemical safety and
radiation emergencies. Although more work remains, these reports
are clear evidence of international commitment and effort to improve
early warning systems, and reduce and manage public health risks.

Ensure inclusive and
equitable quality
education and promote
lifelong learning
opportunities for all
Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to
escaping poverty. Nevertheless, millions of children are still out of
school, and not all who do attend are learning. More than half of
all children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum
proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. Disparities in
educational opportunities and outcomes are found across regions, and
sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central and Southern Asia lag behind.
As a result, many students are not fully prepared to participate in a
highly complex global economy. That gap should provide the incentive
for policymakers to refocus their efforts to ensure that the quality of
education is improved, and that more people of all ages can access it.
Shockingly low proficiency rates in reading and mathematics signal a global learning crisis
Globally, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary
and lower secondary school age—more than 55 per cent of the global
total—lacked minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics
in 2015. One third of those children and adolescents were out of
school and urgently needed access to education. About two thirds of
them attended school but did not become proficient, either because
they dropped out or because they did not learn basic skills. Despite
years of steady growth in enrolment rates, non-proficiency rates
remain disturbingly high. They are highest in sub-Saharan Africa,
where 88 per cent of children (202 million) of primary and lower
secondary school age were not proficient in reading, and 84 per cent
(193 million) were not proficient in mathematics in 2015. Central and
Southern Asia was not faring significantly better. There, 81 per cent of
children (241 million) were not proficient in reading, and 76 per cent
(228 million) lacked basic mathematical skills.
Girls are more likely than boys to learn how to read. Globally, for every
100 boys who achieved minimum proficiency in reading in 2015,
105 girls of primary school age and 109 adolescent women of lower
secondary school age met at least the minimum standard.

The learning crisis not only threatens an individual’s ability to climb
out of poverty, it also jeopardizes the economic future of entire
nations as they struggle to compete in a global marketplace with lessthan-skilled human resources. The next decade provides an important
window of opportunity for policymakers to ensure that all children are
proficient in basic literacy and numeracy.
Early childhood education offers a head start in school, but one third of the world’s children are being left behind
Evidence shows that good quality early childhood education is one
of the best investments a society can make in its children—one that
builds a strong foundation for learning in later years. In fact, early
childhood education has been found to be one of the strongest
determinants of a child’s readiness for school, in both high-income
and low-income countries. Participation in organized learning one
year before the official entry age for primary school has risen steadily
over the past years. At the global level, the participation rate in early
childhood education was 69 per cent in 2017, up from 63 per cent in
2010. However, considerable disparities were found among countries,
with rates ranging from 7 per cent to nearly 100 per cent. The early
childhood education participation rate was only 43 per cent in least
developed countries.

31 Goal 4 | Quality education
Progress has stalled in reaching out-of-school children
Despite considerable progress in educational access and participation,
262 million children and adolescents (6 to 17 years old) were still out of
school in 2017. That represented nearly one fifth of the global population
in that age group. Of that number, 64 million were children of primary
school age (about 6 to 11 years old), 61 million were adolescents of lower
secondary school age (12 to 14 years old), and 138 million were youth of
upper secondary school age (15 to 17 years old).
Girls still face barriers to education in most regions, particularly in
Central Asia, Northern Africa and Western Asia, and sub-Saharan
Africa. In those regions, girls of every age are more likely to be
excluded from education than boys. For every 100 boys of primaryschool age out of school in 2017, 127 girls were denied the right
to education in Central Asia, 121 in sub-Saharan Africa, and 112 in
Northern Africa and Western Asia. At the global level, 118 girls were
out of school for every 100 boys. Recent successes in reducing the
number of children out of school and reducing the gender gap in
the out-of-school rate need to be replicated worldwide to ensure all
children, everywhere, are attending school.
Too many schools in sub-Saharan Africa lack the basic elements of a good quality education: trained teachers
and adequate facilities
Adequate infrastructure and teacher training play a critical role in
the quality of education. Of all regions, sub-Saharan Africa faces the
biggest challenges in providing schools with basic resources. The
situation is extreme at the primary and lower secondary levels, where
less than one half of schools in sub-Saharan Africa have access to
drinking water, electricity, computers and the Internet. At the upper
secondary level, 57 per cent of schools have electricity, but only 25
to 50 per cent have access to drinking water, handwashing facilities,
computers and the Internet.
Another important step towards the goal of good quality education
for all is getting enough trained teachers into classrooms. Here again,
sub-Saharan Africa lags behind. In 2017, that region had the lowest
percentages of trained teachers in pre-primary (48 per cent), primary
(64 per cent) and secondary (50 per cent) education.
Despite progress, 750 million adults still cannot read and write a simple statement; two thirds of those adults
are women
Recent decades have seen improvements in basic reading and writing
skills and a steady reduction in gender gaps, with women’s literacy
rates growing faster than men’s literacy rates in all regions over the
past 25 years. However, 750 million adults—two thirds of whom are
women—remained illiterate in 2016. Adult literacy rates are lowest in
sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Southern Asia alone is home
to nearly half (49 per cent) of the global population who are illiterate.
On a more positive note, youth literacy rates are generally higher than
those of adults. This reflects increased access to schooling among
younger generations, although many students with basic reading and
writing skills still struggle to meet the higher standard of minimum
proficiency in reading and mathematics. The global literacy rate for
adults (15 years of age and older) was 86 per cent in 2016, compared
to 91 per cent for youth (15 to 24 years old). However, youth literacy
remains low in several countries, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.

Achieve gender equality
and empower all
women and girls
The world is a better place for women today than it was in the past.
Fewer girls are forced into early marriage; more women are serving in
parliament and positions of leadership; and laws are being reformed
to advance gender equality. Despite these gains, discriminatory laws
and social norms remain pervasive, along with harmful practices and
other forms of violence against women and girls. Women continue
to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. Across the
globe, women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid
domestic work. Moreover, they continue to face barriers with respect
to their sexual and reproductive health and rights, including legal
restrictions and lack of autonomy in decision-making. Among the
most disadvantaged are women and girls who face the compounded
effects of gender and other forms of discrimination. Achieving gender
equality will require bold and sustainable actions that address the
structural impediments and root causes of discrimination against
women. Equally important, it will require laws and policies that
advance gender equality, backed by adequate resources, as well as
stronger accountability for commitments made to women’s rights.
Women and girls continue to be subjected to harmful practices that profoundly affect their lives
Women and girls around the world continue to experience violence
and cruel practices that strip them of their dignity and erode their
well-being. Intimate partner violence affects women of all ages and
ethnicities, regardless of their socioeconomic status and educational
level, in all countries. According to the latest available data from
106 countries, 18 per cent of ever-partnered women and girls 15 to 49
years old experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a current or
former intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey.
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a deeply troubling human-rights
violation that affects at least 200 million women in the 30 countries
where the practice is concentrated (half of them in West Africa). On
average, the prevalence of FGM has declined by one quarter since
around 2000. Still, on average, about one in three girls 15 to 19 years
old in those countries have been subjected to FGM, compared to
nearly one in two in 2000.
Child marriage—another harmful practice—has continued to decline
around the world, largely driven by progress in Southern Asia. There, a
girl’s risk of marrying in childhood has decreased by over 40 per cent
since 2000. Increasingly, the global burden of child marriage is
shifting from Southern Asia to sub-Saharan Africa, where levels of
child marriage have declined at a more modest rate.
Women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work
On average, women spend roughly triple the amount of time that men
do each day in unpaid care and domestic work, according to the latest
available data from around 90 countries. That work includes a variety
of unpaid activities, such as taking care of children and the elderly, and
domestic chores. Data also suggest that the gender gap widens when
women are most likely to have young children at home.
Inadequate cookstoves, water, sanitation and transportation increase
women’s burdens, as do the lack of early childhood education and
care, long-term care and access to social protection and services.
That burden is compounded by traditional notions of women’s roles in
society. When women are engaged in caregiving and domestic chores,
they have less time for paid work, education and leisure, further
reinforcing their socioeconomic disadvantage.

33 Goal 5 | Gender equality
At home, at work and in political life, women are too often denied decision-making power
As of 1 January 2019, women’s representation in national parliaments
ranged from 0 to 61.3 per cent, averaging 24.3 per cent. This is an
increase of 5 percentage points since 2010. In 103 countries and
areas with relevant data, women’s representation in elected local
deliberative bodies varied from less than 1 per cent to close to parity,
at 50 per cent, with a median of 26 per cent. Women’s representation
in local government is 40 per cent or higher in only 15 countries and
areas. When legislated gender quotas are adopted, significantly higher
proportions of women are elected at both national and local levels.
Countries with higher representation of women in local government
tend to have higher representation in parliament.
In the economic sphere, the world has seen an upward trend in the
proportion of women in managerial positions. Since 2000, that share
has increased in all regions and country groupings, except in least
developed countries. However, it remains disproportionately low.
Women comprised 39 per cent of the workforce in 2018, but held only
27 per cent of managerial positions.
That lack of decision-making power is reflected in the home as well.
According to data from 51 countries, only 57 per cent of women 15 to
49 years old who are married or in a union make their own decisions
about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and reproductive
health services. Women’s and girls’ capacity to make those crucial
decisions for themselves—and to be able to act on them—is essential
to their empowerment and the full exercise of their reproductive rights.
In too many countries, gaps in legal frameworks are failing to protect women’s rights
Over the past 25 years, progress has been made in gender equality
through the creation of new legislation and the reform of existing
laws. Still, troublesome gaps remain. This was the conclusion of
a study of data collected in 2018 and covering four areas of law in
53 countries. In almost one third of the countries studied, gaps were
found in overarching legal frameworks and areas of public life. For
example, nearly two thirds of those countries lacked laws that covered
both direct and indirect discrimination against women. In the area of
violence against women, legal gaps were found in over one quarter
of the countries studied. Of those countries, 68 per cent lacked rape
laws based on the principle of consent. In the areas of employment
and economic benefits, and of marriage and family, 29 per cent and
24 per cent of countries, respectively, had legal gaps. For example, in
more than half of the countries, no laws were in place to mandate equal
pay for work of equal value. Less than one third of the countries had
laws stipulating 18 years as the minimum age of marriage for women
and men, with no exceptions.
Financing gaps limit implementation of laws and policies on gender equality
Gender budgeting aims to link policy and legal requirements for
gender equality with resource allocation. Although progress has
been made in implementing gender budgeting globally, significant
gaps remain. For example, many countries have yet to establish
a comprehensive system to track allocations for gender equality
and to make data publicly available. An analysis of 2018 data from
69 countries and areas found that 13 countries (19 per cent) fully
met those criteria, and 41 countries (59 per cent) approached the
requirements. More often, countries issue directives on gender
budgeting, use sex-disaggregated data to inform budget decisions,
and conduct ex-post-impact assessments. The data also revealed
a gap in policy implementation. Among the same set of countries,
90 per cent had policies and programmes in place to address gender
gaps, but only 43 per cent reported adequate resource allocations to
implement them.

Ensure availability
and sustainable
management of water
and sanitation for all
Fresh water is a precious resource that is essential to human health,
food and energy security, poverty eradication and many other aspects
of sustainable development. Water-related ecosystems have always
provided natural sites for human settlements, along with a wealth of
ecosystem services. Yet, like other natural resources, water is under
threat. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and
half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water
scarcity at least one month a year. Most rivers in Africa, Asia and
Latin America are more polluted now than they were in the 1990s.
An estimated 50 to 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland area
has been lost over the last 100 years. While substantial progress
has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and
sanitation, billions of people—mostly in rural areas—still lack these
basic services. In response, donors increased their aid commitments
to the water sector by 37 per cent between 2016 and 2017. Most
countries have recognized the importance of better coordinating
the use of water resources, and have put in place integrated plans
for their management. However, much more effort is needed to
improve access to water and sanitation services, increase wastewater
treatment, enhance water use efficiency, expand operational
cooperation across transboundary water basins, and protect and
restore freshwater ecosystems.
Despite progress, accelerated action is needed to provide billions of people with safely managed drinking
water and sanitation
Between 2000 and 2017, the proportion of the global population using
safely managed drinking water—the highest level of service—increased
from 61 per cent to 71 per cent. The fastest progress was seen in
Central and Southern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Overall, 90 per cent of the world’s population had at least basic
drinking water services. Despite those gains, 785 million people still
lacked even basic drinking water services in 2017.
The proportion of the global population using safely managed sanitation
services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2017,
with Eastern and South-Eastern Asia making the fastest progress. An
additional 30 per cent of the global population used basic sanitation
services. Despite that progress, an estimated 673 million people
(9 per cent of the global population) still practised open defecation in
2017, the majority of them in Southern Asia. Achieving universal access
to even basic sanitation services by 2030 will require a doubling of the
current annual rate of progress.
In 2017, three out of five people worldwide had a basic handwashing
facility with soap and water on the premises, compared with less
than one out of three (28 per cent) in least developed countries. That
means that, globally, an estimated 3 billion people are still unable to
properly wash their hands at home.
Basic water, sanitation and hygiene services are important not only
in homes, but also in public areas where people congregate. In 2016,
one third of all primary schools lacked basic drinking water, sanitation
and hygiene services. That adversely affected the education and
health of millions of schoolchildren, particularly girls coping with
menstruation. One out of four health-care facilities worldwide also
lacked basic drinking water services, affecting over 2 billion people
and increasing the infection risk of people seeking medical care.

35 Goal 6 | Clean water and sanitation
Water stress affects people on every continent, requiring immediate and collective action
Two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and
about 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity at least one
month a year. Over the last century, global water use has increased
at more than twice the rate of population growth. That growth, along
with rapid urbanization, socioeconomic development and changing
consumption patterns, continues to drive water demand, which is
heightened by climate change. By 2030, an estimated 700 million
people could be displaced by intense water scarcity.
Currently, one third of countries have medium to high levels of water
stress. Countries with high levels of water stress are all located in
Northern Africa and Western Asia and in Central and Southern Asia.
To reduce pressure on freshwater resources, every country and region
needs to increase the use of non-conventional water resources, such
as the reuse of wastewater, desalinated water, and direct use of
agricultural drainage water.
Countries are advancing the integrated management of their water resources, but more rapid progress is needed
Water resources must be carefully managed to ensure sustainability
and equitable sharing among users. A global framework for such
an approach is known as integrated water resources management
(IWRM), and it covers policies, institutions, management
instruments and financing. Of the 172 countries that reported on their
implementation of IWRM in 2018, 80 per cent had medium-low levels
of implementation or higher. That means that they have laid a solid
foundation for implementing the many elements of the approach.
However, 60 per cent of countries were not on track to reach the 2030
target of full implementation. An acceleration of progress is needed,
particularly in the area of sustainable financing. In 2018, the average
global score for IWRM implementation was 49 out of 100.
Community participation is key to ensuring that IWRM is adapted to
local contexts. Seventy per cent of countries reported that they had
procedures in place (defined in either policy or law) for community
participation in the areas of rural drinking water supply and water
resources management. However, implementation of those procedures
is constrained due to the lack of human and financial resources.
Commitments of donor aid to the water sector have increased, while disbursements have levelled off
Disbursements of official development assistance (ODA) by donor
countries to the water sector increased for several years, reaching
nearly $9.1 billion in 2016. However, from 2016 to 2017, ODA
disbursements fell by 2 per cent. That drop may be due to donor
stocktaking in the transition from the Millennium Development Goals
to the Sustainable Development Goals, and corresponds to a fall in
ODA commitments to the water sector between 2012 and 2016 (from
$12.5 billion to $9.5 billion). Encouragingly, ODA commitments spiked
by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017, indicating a renewed focus by
donors on the water sector. That large increase in ODA commitments
was attributed mostly to a tripling of commitments to agricultural
water resources, prompted by new projects in Southern and SouthEastern Asia. Water supply and sanitation also saw a substantial rise
over that period, from $7.6 billion to $9.1 billion, with large increases
in ODA committed to water sector policy and administrative
management as well as to large water supply and sanitation systems.

Ensure access to
affordable, reliable,
sustainable and modern
energy for all
The world is making progress towards Goal 7 with encouraging signs
that energy is becoming more sustainable and widely available.
Access to electricity in poorer countries has begun to accelerate,
energy efficiency continues to improve, and renewable energy is
making impressive gains in the electricity sector. Nevertheless, more
focused attention is needed to improve access to clean and safe
cooking fuels and technologies for 3 billion people, to expand the use
of renewable energy beyond the electricity sector, and to increase
electrification in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nearly 9 out of 10 people now have access to electricity, but reaching the unserved will require increased efforts
More people are using electricity than ever before, with the
proportion of the global population having access to this service rising
from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015, then accelerating
to 89 per cent in 2017 (a gain of 1 percentage point annually in the
past two years). Still, 840 million people were without this essential
service in 2017, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In that region,
only 44 per cent of the population had access, and an estimated
573 million people still lacked electricity.
Globally, electrification of rural areas progressed swiftly between
2015 and 2017, but a large gap remains. In 2017, rural coverage was
78 per cent compared to 97 per cent in urban areas. This means
that 87 per cent of the people currently without electricity live in
rural areas. Future electrification efforts will face the complexities of
reaching unserved populations, including those who are displaced or
living in remote, hard-to-reach communities and those connected to a
frail and overburdened urban grid.
Three billion people still lack clean cooking fuels and technologies, posing a grave threat to human health and
the environment
Access to clean and safe cooking fuels and technologies has increased
since 2010 at an annual rate of 0.5 percentage points, reaching
61 per cent of the global population in 2017. This is far too slow to
meet the SDG target and still leaves nearly 3 billion people dependent
on inefficient and highly polluting cooking systems, resulting in
nearly 4 million premature deaths each year. The lack of cleaner fuels
and technologies remains a major contributor to poor health and
environmental degradation in low- and middle-income countries.
In sub-Saharan Africa, advances in the use of clean fuels (such as
liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas and electricity) and fuel-efficient
stoves have not kept pace with population growth, in contrast to other
regions. Tackling the problem will require concerted action on the
part of policymakers to address key barriers, including availability,
affordability, reliability, limited financing and consumer awareness.

37 Goal 7 | Affordable and clean energy
Progress in the electricity sector must extend to transportation and heating to meet an ambitious renewable
energy target
The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption
reached 17.5 per cent in 2016, up from 16.6 per cent in 2010. In
absolute terms, renewable energy consumption grew by 18 per cent
over that period. The share of modern renewable energy increased
at a faster pace, from 8.6 per cent in 2010 to 10.2 per cent in 2016.
This category excludes traditional biomass use—that is, the inefficient
use of solid biomass, such as the burning of wood, charcoal or other
organic matter.
Most growth in renewable energy has been concentrated in the
electricity sector. This is mainly due to the rapid expansion of wind and
solar power, prompted by sustained policy support and cost reductions.
However, electricity makes up only 20 per cent of final energy use. The
remaining 80 per cent is concentrated in the heat and transport sectors,
where modern renewables penetrated only 9 per cent and 3.3 per cent
of the global market, respectively, in 2016. Meeting the ambitious SDG
target will require increased policy attention to the deployment of
modern renewables in both of these key sectors.
Energy efficiency continues to improve, but more concerted action is needed to reach the SDG target
Improving energy efficiency—along with increasing energy access and
affordability—is central to the global goal of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. Primary energy intensity, defined as total energy supply
per unit of GDP, improved by 2.5 per cent in 2016, bringing the annual
rate of improvement between 2010 and 2016 to 2.3 per cent. This is
far better than the progress observed between 1990 and 2010, when
annual improvements averaged 1.3 per cent. However, it still falls short
of the SDG target of at least 2.7 per cent. What’s more, the latest
estimates for 2017 and 2018 suggest a slowdown in improvement.
To boost progress, governments will need to set their energy
efficiency ambitions higher. Fortunately, a range of policy options are
available, all of which have been implemented in some form, to spur
efficiency gains and provide the basis for more effective action.
International financing for renewable energy in developing countries is rising sharply
From 2000 to 2009, official international financing commitments for
clean and renewable energy in developing countries ranged from $1
billion to $4 billion a year. Commitments rose to $9.9 billion in 2010
and to $18.6 billion by 2016, a tenfold increase from the early 2000s.
Yearly financial flows fluctuated greatly, mainly due to the timing
of large-scale hydropower investments. But overall, the share of
hydropower in the total flow fell from 60 per cent between 2000 and
2009 to around 40 per cent between 2010 and 2016, while the shares
of wind, geothermal and, especially, solar energy, increased. Average
project size also grew from an average of $10 million per project
between 2000 and 2009 to $19 million between 2014 and 2016.

Labour productivity is rising, although wide disparities can be found among regions
Since the global economic downturn of 2009, labour productivity
(measured as GDP per employed person) has been increasing
worldwide, with consistently positive annual growth rates since 2010.
In 2018, labour productivity increased by 2.1 per cent globally, the
highest annual growth since 2010. However, wide disparities are
found across regions. Between 2017 and 2018, average output per
worker grew the most in Central and Southern Asia (4.8 per cent) and
in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia (4.2 per cent), while little changed
in sub-Saharan Africa (0.3 per cent) and in Latin America and the
Caribbean (0.5 per cent).
Promote sustained,
inclusive and
sustainable economic
growth, full and
productive employment
and decent work for all
Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create
decent jobs for all and improve living standards. Globally, real GDP
per capita and labour productivity have increased, and unemployment
has dropped back to pre-financial-crisis levels. However, sluggish
growth overall has prompted a rethinking of economic and social
policies to achieve the transformational objectives of Goal 8 so
as to meet economic growth targets in least developed countries;
increase employment opportunities, especially for young people;
reduce inequalities across regions, age groups and genders; decrease
informal employment; and promote safe and secure working
environments for all workers.
Economic growth in least developed countries is again on the upswing, but the 7 per cent target is still
out of reach
Real GDP per capita—a proxy for the average standard of living—
increased globally by 1.9 per cent in 2017, compared to by 1.3 per cent
in 2016. That growth is expected to remain steady at about 2 per cent
until 2020. In least developed countries (LDCs), the SDG target
aims for at least 7 per cent real GDP growth. In those countries,
real GDP accelerated from an average annual rate of 5.8 per cent
over the period 2000 to 2004, to 7.1 per cent over 2005 to 2009,
before slowing to 4.8 per cent over 2010 to 2017. Growth in LDCs
is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent in 2020 owing to favourable
external economic conditions along with stable commodity prices that
encourage financial flows and investment in natural resource projects
and infrastructure. However, this still falls short of the target. Policies
that promote economic diversification in those countries are needed
to ensure long-term sustainability and more inclusive growth.

39 Goal 8 | Decent work and economic growth
Informal employment remains a major challenge to
the goal of decent work for all
Informal employment remains pervasive throughout the developing
world. Based on the latest available data for 54 developing countries,
in three quarters of countries, more than half of those with jobs in
non-agricultural sectors are informally employed. In about 70 per cent
of countries, the share of informal employment in non-agricultural
sectors is higher for women than for men. These findings warrant
urgent attention from policymakers given the adverse impact of
informal employment on earnings, social protection, occupational
safety, health and working conditions generally. Informal employment
is linked to higher poverty rates and is a major challenge to the goal of
decent work for all.
The continuing pay gap between women and men is a
glaring reminder of gender inequality
Women still earn less than men. An analysis of the latest available
data for 62 countries found that men’s median hourly pay is
12 per cent higher than that of women. Furthermore, men had a wage
advantage in every major occupational category in 49 countries with
relevant data. The median gender pay gap exceeded 20 per cent in
managerial and professional occupations, and among craft and related
trade workers and plant machine operators and assemblers. Gender
pay gaps are rooted in rigid social norms and cultural expectations
about women’s roles in society. When combined with differences in
employment opportunities and lower access to social protection, they
can result in long-term income gaps and compromise gender equality
now and in the future.
The global unemployment rate is steadily dropping, but remains high in some regions and among youth
The global unemployment rate has finally recovered from the global
financial crisis of 2009. In 2018, it stood at 5 per cent—matching
the pre-crisis level. However, large disparities exist across regions
and age groups. In 2018, the unemployment rates in Northern
Africa and Western Asia (9.9 per cent) and Latin America and the
Caribbean (8.0 per cent) were over 2.5 times higher than those in
Central and Southern Asia (3.2 per cent). While gender disparities
in unemployment rates are less than 1 per cent globally, they are
alarming in some regions, such as Western Asia and Northern
Africa. In those regions, the unemployment rate for women was over
8 percentage points higher than for men in 2018; in Latin America
and the Caribbean, the rate for women was almost 3 percentage
points higher. What’s more, youth are three times more likely to be
unemployed than adults. In 2018, the youth unemployment rate was
12 per cent compared to 4 per cent for adults.
The talents and energy of one fifth of the world’s youth are not being effectively harnessed
In 2018, one fifth of the world’s youth were not engaged in either
education, employment or training (NEET). In other words, they were
neither gaining professional experience nor acquiring or developing
skills through educational or vocational programmes during that
formative stage of life. The situation is most serious in Central and
Southern Asia and in Northern African and Western Asia, where more
than one quarter of youth fall into this category.
Gender differences in this regard are pervasive. In 2018, young
women were more than twice as likely as young men to be
unemployed or outside the labour force and not in school or in a
training programme (young women had a NEET rate of 30 per cent
compared to 13 per cent for young men). In Central and Southern
Asia, 46 per cent of young women fell into this category compared to
10 per cent of young men.

Build resilient
infrastructure,
promote inclusive
and sustainable
industrialization and
foster innovation
Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation
and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic
forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in
introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international
trade and enabling the efficient use of resources. However, the
world still has a long way to go to fully tap this potential. LDCs, in
particular, need to accelerate the development of their manufacturing
sector if they are to meet the 2030 target, and scale up investment
in scientific research and innovation. On a positive note, the carbon
intensity of manufacturing industries declined at an annual rate of
almost 3 per cent from 2010 and 2016, showing a general decoupling
of CO2 emissions and GDP growth. Total official flows for economic
infrastructure in developing countries reached $59 billion in 2017, an
increase of 32.5 per cent in real terms since 2010. Further, impressive
gains have been made in mobile connectivity.
Despite recent progress, industrialization in least developed countries is still too slow to meet the 2030 target
The growth of manufacturing in both developing and developed
regions slowed in 2018, attributed largely to emerging trade and tariff
barriers that constrain investment and future expansion. Despite
the slowdown, the global share of manufacturing value added
(MVA) in GDP increased marginally—from 15.9 per cent in 2008 to
16.5 per cent in 2018, when it began to plateau. In LDCs, the share of
manufacturing in total GDP increased 2.5 per cent annually between
2015 and 2018. However, that still falls short of the pace needed to
achieve a doubling of the MVA share in GDP by 2030, and calls for
accelerated action. The disparities in industrial productivity between
rich and poor nations remain stark. For instance, MVA per capita
was only $114 in LDCs compared to $4,938 in Europe and Northern
America, in 2018.
Small-scale industries in the poorest countries lack the financial services they need to grow and innovate
Small-scale industries are the backbone of industrial development
in developing countries. With a relatively small amount of capital
investment and a predominantly local resource base, small-scale
industries generate a substantial amount of employment and selfemployment. However, one of the biggest challenges those industries
face is access to loans or lines of credit for everyday business
activities. Adequate financing is crucial for those industries to grow,
since it allows them to innovate, improve efficiency, expand to new
markets and create new job opportunities. While 31.5 per cent of
small-scale industries (manufacturing and services) worldwide
benefit from loans or lines of credit, regional differences stand out. For
instance, more than half of all small-scale industries in Latin America
and the Caribbean receive those types of financial services, compared
to 20.7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.

Higher-tech manufacturing is growing worldwide, except in sub-Saharan Africa
Recent years have seen a steady shift away from resource-based, lowtech manufacturing activities towards those that are medium-high- to
high-tech. Those higher-tech manufacturing sectors are often reliant
on the latest technologies and produce a wide array of consumer
goods, from computers, televisions and other communications
devices to appliances and other household equipment. The demand
for such products tends to increase as income levels rise.
The share of medium-high- and high-tech industries in total MVA
increased from 40.5 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2016, with
large differences across regions. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and
in Europe and Northern America, for example, over 47 per cent of total
MVA came from higher-tech sectors in 2016. In contrast, the shares in
Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and sub-Saharan Africa
were only 1.9 per cent and 14.9 per cent, respectively. In sub-Saharan
Africa, the proportion of medium-high- and high-tech MVA in total
MVA actually fell between 2000 and 2016, but rose in all other regions.
Global spending on research and development has reached $2 trillion a year, with wide disparities among
countries
The proportion of global GDP invested in research and development
(R&D) increased from 1.52 per cent in 2000 to 1.68 per cent in
2016. In absolute terms, global R&D investment reached $2 trillion
(purchasing power parity) in 2016, up from $739 billion in 2000.
That represents an average annual growth rate of 4.3 per cent when
adjusted for inflation. Wide disparities are found among regions.
In Europe and Northern America, 2.21 per cent of GDP was spent
on R&D in 2016, compared to 0.42 per cent and 0.83 per cent,
respectively, in sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia. Such disparities
indicate the continued need for strong policy support for increased
financing for R&D in developing regions.
Almost everyone now lives within range of mobile-cellular networks, but not all can afford to use them
Fixed-broadband Internet connections remain out of reach for many
people. But coverage of mobile-cellular signals and mobile-broadband
Internet has expanded rapidly, now reaching almost the entire global
population. In 2018, 96 per cent of the world’s population lived within
reach of a mobile-cellular signal, and 90 per cent of people could
access the Internet through a third generation (3G) or higher-quality
network. However, while most live within range of these signals, not
all are able to take advantage of them. The cost of accessing mobilecellular networks and mobile-broadband Internet remains too high
for many, particularly the most disadvantaged and at-risk population
groups. In fact, just over half of the world’s population is currently
using the Internet, with rates much lower in LDCs (about 20 per cent).

Reduce inequality
within and among
countries
Inequality within and among countries is a persistent cause for
concern, despite progress in some areas. Income inequality continues
to rise in many parts of the world, even as the poorest 40 per cent
of the population in most countries experience income growth.
Greater focus is needed to reduce income and other inequalities,
including those related to labour market access and trade. Specifically,
additional efforts are needed to further increase zero-tariff access for
exports from poorer countries, and to provide technical assistance
to LDCs and small island developing States seeking to benefit from
preferential trade status.
Data show mixed progress on the sharing of prosperity within countries
To gauge whether the poorest people in a country are participating in
economic progress, it is useful to compare the growth of household
income (or consumption) of the poorest 40 per cent with that of the
population as a whole. That provides one indication of whether overall
prosperity is being shared with the bottom 40 per cent of the income
ladder in a country.
In 92 countries with comparable data over the period 2011 to 2016,
the results were mixed. In 69 countries, the poorest 40 per cent saw
their income grow, but with large variations among countries. In 50 of
those 69 countries, income growth in the poorest 40 per cent of the
population was faster than the national average. Notably, however,
the bottom 40 per cent still received less than 25 per cent of overall
income. In many countries, an increasing share of income goes to the
top 1 per cent.
Data measuring household income for that analysis were limited. Only
13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa had data on income growth for the
most recent period. That points to the ongoing need for improved data
collection and statistical capacity-building, especially in the poorest
countries.
Rich and poor countries alike can benefit from
policies promoting equality and inclusivity
An important development objective for many countries is easing
inequality and addressing social inclusion. One indicator of relative
poverty and inequality is the share of people living below 50 per cent
of the median income level. An analysis of data from 110 high- and
low-income countries showed that the median country had
14 per cent of the population with income levels below that threshold.
The most unequal country had 26 per cent below that threshold,
and the most equal country had 3 per cent. But both rich and poor
countries have high and low levels of inequality. Income inequality is
not strongly correlated with either poverty or affluence, suggesting
that policies promoting equality and inclusivity have universal
relevance.
Countries with a high proportion of non-performing
loans need to attend to the health of their banking
systems
The stability of a country’s financial system is key to efficiently
allocating resources, managing risks, and ensuring that
macroeconomic objectives that benefit all are met. One measure
of financial stability is the share of non-performing loans in relation
to total loans to depositors in a banking system. An analysis of 138
countries from 2010 to 2017 showed that, in half of the countries,
non-performing loans made up less than 5 per cent of total loans.
In 2017, more than one quarter of the countries showed a higher
percentage of non-performing loans (10 per cent or more), and
four countries showed a proportion higher than 30 per cent. A high
proportion of non-performing loans usually affects profitability and
undermines the broader business environment, which can have
consequences for economic growth, unemployment and other factors
affecting inequality.

43 Goal 10 | Reduced inequalities
Globally, the share of national output used to remunerate workers is declining
The share of national income that goes to labour is one indication
of whether economic growth will translate into higher incomes for
workers over time. Increased national income can lead to improved
living standards, but that depends on its distribution across aspects of
production, including labour, capital and land.
Globally, the share of national income going to labour has shown a
downward trend since 2004. That means that the share of national
output used to remunerate workers has declined. The decrease was
temporarily reversed during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009
due to a sudden contraction in GDP. Central and Southern Asia
and Europe and Northern America were the main drivers of the
declining global labour share. Between 2004 and 2017, the adjusted
labour share of GDP decreased by more than 5 percentage points in
Central and Southern Asia (from 51.2 to 45.8 per cent) and close to
2 percentage points in Europe and Northern America (from 59.6 to
57.6 per cent). Conversely, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the
labour income share increased from 48.4 to 50.5 per cent during the
same period.
Policies to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration are widespread, but far from universal
The majority of countries have policies that facilitate the orderly,
safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people. Yet
significant differences can be found across the six policy domains of
this indicator. For each domain, more than half of the 105 countries
with available data have a comprehensive set of policy measures,
meaning that they reported having migration policy measures for
80 per cent or more of the subcategories of each domain. Migrant
rights and socioeconomic well-being are the areas demonstrating
the largest policy gaps, with over 40 per cent of countries lacking a
comprehensive set of measures in those domains. Policies to promote
cooperation and partnerships and to facilitate safe, orderly and
regular migration are the most widespread, with more than three
quarters of countries reporting a wide range of such measures.
Lower-income countries continue to benefit from preferential trade status
Duty-free access continued to increase for exports from LDCs, small
island developing States and developing regions at large. LDCs saw
the biggest benefits: coverage of duty-free treatment increased by
5.5 percentage points between 2016 and 2017, reaching 65.6 per cent
of all products exported. About 51 per cent of exports from developing
regions have now become eligible for duty-free treatment.
At the sector level, improvements in the treatment of LDCs were
primarily due to growing duty-free access for agricultural and
industrial products (increases of 7.3 and 5.4 percentage points,
respectively). However, such access for LDCs and other developing
countries is not automatic at customs checkpoints. Exporters need
to comply with rules-of-origin certification processes to benefit from
preferential treatment. Those procedures can be costly and timeconsuming for small- and medium-sized enterprises, lowering their
incentive to apply for preferential treatment.

Make cities and human
settlements inclusive,
safe, resilient and
sustainable
The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than
half the world’s population has been living in cities, and that share
is projected to rise to 60 per cent by 2030. Cities and metropolitan
areas are powerhouses of economic growth—contributing about
60 per cent of global GDP. However, they also account for about
70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over 60 per cent of
resource use. Rapid urbanization is resulting in a growing number
of slum dwellers, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and
services (such as waste collection and water and sanitation systems,
roads and transport), worsening air pollution and unplanned urban
sprawl. To respond to those challenges, 150 countries have developed
national urban plans, with almost half of them in the implementation
phase. Ensuring that those plans are well executed will help cities
grow in a more sustainable and inclusive manner.
Rapid urbanization and population growth are outpacing the construction of adequate and affordable housing
The proportion of the urban population living in slums worldwide
declined by 20 per cent between 2000 and 2014 (from 28 per cent
to 23 per cent). That positive trend recently reversed course, and the
proportion grew to 23.5 per cent in 2018. The absolute number of
people living in slums or informal settlements grew to over 1 billion,
with 80 per cent attributed to three regions: Eastern and SouthEastern Asia (370 million), sub-Saharan Africa (238 million) and
Central and Southern Asia (227 million). An estimated 3 billion people
will require adequate and affordable housing by 2030.
The growing number of slum dwellers is the result of both
urbanization and population growth that are outpacing the
construction of new affordable homes. Adequate housing is a human
right, and the absence of it negatively affects urban equity and
inclusion, health and safety, and livelihood opportunities. Renewed
policy attention and increased investments are needed to ensure
affordable and adequate housing for all by 2030.
Access to public transport is increasing, but faster progress is needed in developing regions
Public transport is an essential service for urban residents and a
catalyst for economic growth and social inclusion. Moreover, with
ever-increasing numbers of people moving to urban areas, the use of
public transport is helping to mitigate air pollution and climate change.
According to 2018 data from 227 cities, in 78 countries, 53 per cent
of urban residents had convenient access to public transport (defined
as residing within 500 metres walking distance of a bus stop or a lowcapacity transport system or within 1,000 metres of a railway and/
or ferry terminal). In most regions, the number of people using public
transport rose by nearly 20 per cent between 2001 and 2014. SubSaharan Africa lagged behind, with only 18 per cent of its residents
having convenient access to public transport. In some regions with
low access, informal transport modes are widely available and, in
many cases, provide reliable transport. Stronger efforts are needed
to ensure that sustainable transport is available to all, particularly to
vulnerable populations such as women, children, seniors and persons
with disabilities.

Municipal waste is mounting, highlighting the growing need for investment in urban infrastructure
Globally, 2 billion people were without waste collection services, and
3 billion people lacked access to controlled waste disposal facilities,
according to data collected between 2010 and 2018. The problem
will only worsen as urbanization increases, income levels rise and
economies become more consumer-oriented. The total amount of
waste generated globally is expected to double from nearly 2 billion
metric tons in 2016 to about 4 billion metric tons by 2050.
The proportion of municipal solid waste collected regularly increased
from 76 per cent between 2001 and 2010 to 81 per cent between
2010 and 2018. But that does not mean that it was disposed of
properly. Many municipal solid waste disposal facilities in low- and
middle-income countries are open dumpsites, which contribute to
air, water and soil pollution, including by plastic waste, as well as
emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane. Investment in
waste management infrastructure is urgently needed to improve the
handling of solid waste across much of the world.
In too many cities, air pollution has become an unavoidable health hazard
Nine out of ten urban residents in 2016 were breathing polluted air—
that is, air that did not meet the WHO air quality guidelines for annual
mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of 10 micrograms or
less per cubic metre. More than half of those people were exposed
to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times above the guideline value. Air
quality worsened between 2010 and 2016 for more than 50 per cent
of the world’s population. Central and Southern Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa are the two regions that saw the largest increases in particulate
matter concentrations.
In low- and middle-income countries, the air quality of 97 per cent of
cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants did not meet air quality
guidelines in 2016, compared to 49 per cent in high-income countries.
Ambient air pollution from traffic, industry, power generation, waste
burning and residential fuel combustion, combined with household air
pollution, poses a major threat to both human health and efforts to curb
climate change. More than 90 per cent of air-pollution-related deaths
occur in low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Asia and Africa.
Open public spaces make cities more inclusive, but many residents are not within easy walking distance of them
A connective matrix of streets and public spaces forms the skeleton
of the city upon which everything else rests. Where public space
is inadequate, poorly designed or privatized, the city becomes
increasingly segregated. Investment in networks of streets and open
public spaces improves urban productivity, livelihoods and access to
markets, jobs and public services, especially in countries where over
half of the urban workforce is informal.
Based on 2018 data from 220 cities, in 77 countries, few cities have
been able to implement a system of open public spaces that covers
entire urban areas—that is, within easy reach of all residents. Findings
show that the average share of the population within 400 metres
walking distance of an open public space is around 31 per cent, with
huge variations among cities (from a low of 5 per cent to a high of
90 per cent). A low percentage does not necessarily mean that an
inadequate share of land is open public space, but rather that the
distribution of such spaces across the city is uneven.

Ensure sustainable

very systems on which our future development—indeed, our very
survival—depends. Globally, we continue to use ever-increasing
amounts of natural resources to support our economic activity. The
efficiency with which such resources are used remains unchanged
at the global level, thus we have not yet seen a decoupling of
economic growth and natural resource use. Globally, the generation
of waste is mounting. About one third of the food produced for
human consumption each year is lost or wasted, most of it in
developed countries. Urgent action is needed to ensure that current
material needs do not lead to over-extraction of resources and
further degradation of the environment. Policies must be embraced
to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and mainstream
sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy.
Shrinking our material footprint is a global imperative
“Material footprint” refers to the total amount of raw materials
extracted to meet final consumption demands. It is one indication of
the pressures placed on the environment to support economic growth
and to satisfy the material needs of people. The global material
footprint rose from 43 billion metric tons in 1990 to 54 billion in
2000, and 92 billion in 2017—an increase of 70 per cent since 2000,
and 113 per cent since 1990. The rate of natural resource extraction
has accelerated since 2000. Without concerted political action, it is
projected to grow to 190 billion metric tons by 2060. What’s more,
the global material footprint is increasing at a faster rate than both
population and economic output. In other words, at the global level,
there has been no decoupling of material footprint growth from either
population growth or GDP growth. It is imperative that we reverse
that trend.
The lifestyles of people in the richest nations are heavily dependent on resources extracted from poorer
countries
The material footprint per capita has also increased at an alarming
rate. In 1990, about 8.1 metric tons of natural resources were used
to satisfy an individual’s needs. In 2017, that rose to 12.2 metric tons,
an increase of 50 per cent. That year, high-income countries had the
highest material footprint per capita (approximately 27 metric tons
per person), 60 per cent higher than the upper-middle-income
countries (17 metric tons per person) and more than 13 times the level
of low-income countries (2 metric tons per person). The material
footprint of high-income countries is greater than their domestic
material consumption, indicating that consumption in those countries
relies on materials from other countries through international
supply chains. On a per-capita basis, high-income countries rely on
9.8 metric tons of primary materials extracted elsewhere in the world.

47 Goal 12 | Responsible consumption and production
Improvements in the efficiency of resource use are not proceeding fast enough
Domestic material consumption (DMC) measures the total amount
of materials directly used by an economy to meet the demands for
goods and services from within and outside a country. At the global
level, DMC is equivalent to the material footprint, and reached
92 billion metric tons in 2017. DMC increased from 2010 to 2017 in
all regions of the world. Particularly striking is the increase in Eastern
and South-Eastern Asia, where about 10 billion more metric tons were
used in 2017 than in 2010. That increase accounts for about two thirds
of the increase at the global level.
The rising share of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and other
emerging economies in global DMC is due to two dynamics. The first
is the construction of new infrastructure in emerging and transitioning
economies, a pattern that many developing countries are likely to
follow in the future. The second is the outsourcing of the material- and
energy-intensive stages of production from high-income nations to
less resource-efficient countries. The shift in production from the
former to the latter means that more natural resources are needed to
produce the same output.
Because that shift in economic activity happened faster than
improvements in resource efficiency in individual countries,
material intensity—defined as domestic material consumption per
GDP—stagnated at an average of 1.16 kilograms per dollar from
2010 to 2017. In 2017, developed countries used about one fifth
as many natural resources as developing countries to produce the
same amount of economic output. Between 2010 and 2017, material
intensity decreased in many regions, showing some progress towards
the relative decoupling of economic output and DMC. But material
intensity increased in other regions, resulting in no change at the
global level. Good progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa,
Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New
Zealand), mostly as a result of increases in GDP.
Progress in sustainable consumption and production furthers progress in all the SDGs
The transition towards sustainable and resilient societies will
ultimately depend on the responsible management of the planet’s
finite natural resources. Well-designed national policy frameworks
and instruments are necessary to enable the fundamental shift
towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. In 2018,
71 countries and the European Union reported on a total of 303 such
policies and instruments.
A pilot study of 262 reported policies and instruments showed that,
while the potential economic benefits of sustainable consumption
and production processes are well recognized, social benefits are
still largely overlooked. That is, social benefits are rarely included
in policy objectives or measured. For instance, 63 per cent of the
reported policies and instruments examined their impact on air, soil
and water pollution, 45 per cent on waste reduction and 43 per cent
on greenhouse gas emissions. Only 11 per cent considered their
impact on health, and 7 per cent looked at their impact on gender.
Demonstrating the benefits of such policies to all the SDGs will be
essential to understanding the overall contribution of sustainable
consumption and production to sustainable development, and to
building the coalition needed to support a transformative shift.

Take urgent action to
combat climate change
and its impacts
As greenhouse gas levels continue to climb, climate change is
occurring much faster than anticipated, and its effects are evident
worldwide. The global mean temperature for 2018 was approximately
1°C above the pre-industrial baseline, and the last four years have
been the warmest on record. Sea levels continue to rise at an
accelerating rate.
Climate change is the defining issue of our time and the greatest
challenge to sustainable development. Its compounding effects are
speeding up its advance, leaving very little time to act if we want to
prevent runaway climate change. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C
is necessary to avoid catastrophic consequences and irreversible
changes. That will require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy,
land and urban infrastructure and industrial systems.
While countries have taken positive steps by preparing nationally
determined contributions (NDCs) and increasing financing to combat
climate change, far more ambitious plans and unprecedented changes
in all aspects of society are required. Access to finance and the
strengthening of resilience and adaptive capacity need to be scaled
up at a much faster pace, particularly among LDCs and small island
developing States.
Unprecedented changes in all aspects of society will be required to avoid the worst effects of climate change
In 2017, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 405.5 parts
per million (ppm) (up from 400.1 ppm in 2015), representing
146 per cent of pre-industrial levels. To limit global warming to
1.5°C means that emissions will need to peak as soon as possible,
followed by rapid reductions. Global carbon emissions need to fall by
a staggering 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels and continue at a
steep decline to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
As of May 2019, 186 Parties had ratified the Paris Agreement. Parties
to the agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain
successive NDCs (including targets, policies and actions planned
in response to climate change). As of that same date, 183 Parties
(182 countries plus the European Union) had communicated their
first NDCs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change Secretariat, and one Party had communicated its second
NDC. Parties have been requested to update their existing NDCs or
communicate new ones by 2020. To achieve the 2030 objectives,
countries will need to be far more ambitious in preparing their new
NDCs for submission.
Countries are developing disaster risk reduction strategies in the face of growing climate threats
As described in Goal 1, climate change is already exacerbating
disaster risk. From 1998 to 2017, climate-related disasters around
the world accounted for 77 per cent of the nearly $3 trillion in direct
economic losses from disasters. Over that period, climate-related
and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. The
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 outlines
clear targets and priorities for action to prevent new disaster risks and
reduce existing ones. Since its adoption, countries have been making
efforts to develop and implement, by 2020, national and local disaster
risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework. In the
latest reports (2017–2018) from 70 countries, 67 had strategies that
were aligned to some extent with the Sendai Framework. The biggest
challenges are investment in disaster risk reduction for resilience and
promoting policy coherence between the SDGs and climate change.
Many local governments had developed local strategies in line with
national strategies.

49 Goal 13 | Climate action
Climate-related financial flows have increased, but are small in relation to the scale of the problem and still
overshadowed by investments in fossil fuels
Globally, climate-related financial flows have increased, with most of
the funds dedicated to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. A relatively
small share is helping countries adapt to the effects of climate change.
The third biennial assessment by the United Nations Climate Change
Secretariat Standing Committee on Finance shows a 17 per cent
increase in global climate finance from 2013–2014 to 2015–2016.
Upper-limit estimates rose from $584 billion in 2014 to $680 billion
in 2015 and to $681 billion in 2016. The spurt in growth from 2014 to
2015 was driven largely by high levels of new private investment in
renewable energy, which is the largest segment of the global total.
While those financial flows are considerable, they are relatively small
in relation to the scale of the problem and wider trends in global
investment. Moreover, investments in climate activities are still
surpassed by those related to fossil fuels ($781 billion in 2016).
Climate-related financing for developing countries increased by
24 per cent in 2015 to $33 billion, and by 14 per cent in 2016 to
$38 billion. Financing channelled through United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change funds and multilateral climate funds
in 2015 and 2016 totalled $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.
The increase from 2015 to 2016 is attributed to the ramping up of
operations by the Green Climate Fund.
More countries are making plans to boost their resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change
Many developing countries have launched a process to formulate
and implement national adaptation plans (NAPs) to reduce their
vulnerability to climate change and to integrate climate change
adaptation into national development planning. Those plans will
help countries achieve the global goal on adaptation under the Paris
Agreement—namely, to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen
resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. Thirteen
countries, four of which are LDCs, have completed and submitted
their NAPs to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, while many others are at various
stages in the process. Since 2015, the number of countries that have
launched or initiated NAPs has increased by 45 per cent.
Funding for the formulation of NAPs is provided by the Green Climate
Fund Readiness and Preparatory Support Programme and the Least
Developed Countries Fund. As of May 2019, 75 countries had sought a
total of $191 million in support from the Green Climate Fund for NAPs
and other adaptation planning processes. Of those, 28 countries had
accessed a total of $75 million, two thirds of which went to LDCs,
small island developing States and countries in Africa. Another seven
countries were in the final stage of approval for a total of $17 million
in funding. Nine project proposals under the Least Developed
Countries Fund were also approved to support the formulation
and implementation of NAPs. Technical guidance and support to
developing countries for NAPs is provided by the Least Developed
Countries Expert Group and other constituted bodies under the
United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change. A total of
154 support activities have been reported since 2014.

Laying the groundwork
and addressing gaps
The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019 50
Life depends on oceans. They make up the planet’s largest
ecosystem—covering more than two thirds of the Earth’s surface—
and provide billions of people with food and livelihoods. Oceans
produce about half the oxygen we breathe, and act as a climate
regulator, absorbing atmospheric heat and more than one quarter of
man-made CO2. However, decades of increasing carbon emissions
have led to a build-up of heat in the oceans and changes in their
chemical composition. The resulting adverse effects of ocean
acidification, climate change (including sea-level rise), extreme
weather events and coastal erosion exacerbate ongoing threats to
marine and coastal resources from overfishing, pollution and habitat
degradation. Protected areas and policies and treaties that encourage
responsible extraction of ocean resources are critical to confronting
these threats.
Conserve and
sustainably use the
oceans, seas and
marine resources
for sustainable
development
Land-based pollutants and marine debris threaten coastal habitats, but improvements in water quality are
achievable
Coastal areas worldwide are affected by land-based pollutants,
including sewage and nutrient runoff, leading to coastal eutrophication,
degraded water quality and the impairment of coastal marine
ecosystems. Analysis of the clean water indicator, a measurement of
the degree of ocean pollution, shows that water quality challenges are
widespread, but are most acute in some equatorial zones, especially in
parts of Asia, Africa and Central America.
Nearly all countries have room to improve their coastal water quality.
Analysis of trends from 2012 to 2018 shows that positive change is
indeed possible: 104 of 220 coastal regions improved their coastal
water quality over that period. Such improvements require policy
commitments at the country level to expand access to wastewater
treatment and to reduce chemical and nutrient runoff from agricultural
sources, along with global commitments to reduce plastic debris.
Increasing acidification is threatening marine life and hampering the ocean’s role in moderating climate change
The uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean changes the chemical
composition of seawater, altering its carbonate chemistry and
resulting in a decrease of pH (and growing ocean acidification).
Observations of ocean pH over the past 30 years have shown a
decrease in surface pH of 0.1 units. This is equivalent to a 26 per cent
increase in acidity from pre-industrial times. At the current rate of
CO2 emissions, an increase in acidity of 100 to 150 per cent by the end
of this century is predicted.
Ocean acidification threatens organisms as well as ecosystem
services, including food security, by endangering fisheries and
aquaculture. It also impacts coastal protection (by weakening coral
reefs, which shield the coastline), transportation and tourism. As
the acidity of the ocean rises, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the
atmosphere decreases, hampering the ocean’s role in moderating
climate change.

51 Goal 14 | Life below water
The extent of marine protected areas has doubled since 2010, but more must be done to safeguard key
biodiversity areas
Protected areas play a critical role in sustainable development if
they are both effectively managed and located in areas important
for biodiversity. As of December 2018, 17 per cent of waters under
national jurisdiction were covered by protected areas. This is a
significant increase from 12 per cent in 2015 and more than double
the coverage level in 2010. The mean percentage of marine key
biodiversity areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas also increased
from 31.2 per cent in 2000 to 45.7 per cent in 2018.
Despite that progress, the rate at which KBAs are being protected
has slowed and, if current trends continue, will flatten by 2030.
Developing countries, in particular LDCs and small island developing
States, are lagging behind. A redoubling of efforts is needed
to establish new marine protected areas and to strengthen the
management of existing ones.
The decline in fish stocks appears to have stabilized; now they need to be rebuilt, especially in severely
depleted regions
To preserve the health and productivity of fisheries, fish stocks must
be maintained within biologically sustainable levels. Overfishing not
only reduces food production, but also impairs the functioning of
ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for
the economy and society. Worldwide, the proportion of marine fish
stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from
90 per cent in 1974 to 67 per cent in 2015. However, this decreasing
trend appears to have stabilized since 2008—an encouraging sign.
In 2015, the Mediterranean and Black Sea region had the lowest
percentage of sustainable fish stocks (37.8 per cent), followed closely
by the Southeast Pacific region (38.5 per cent). In contrast, the
Eastern Central Pacific and Northeast Pacific regions had the highest
proportion of fish stocks at biologically sustainable levels (above
85 per cent). More focused efforts are needed to rebuild overfished
stocks, particularly in severely depleted regions.
States have taken important steps to combat illegal,
unreported and unregulated fishing
Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing remains one of
the greatest threats to marine ecosystems. Ruthless poaching in
fisheries often leads to their collapse, threatening livelihoods and
exacerbating poverty and food insecurity. Small-scale fisheries in
developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Countries have
developed a range of international instruments to combat illegal
fishing within a global framework to address fisheries management.
The first international binding agreement developed expressly
to combat IUU fishing, the Agreement on Port State Measures,
entered into force in June 2016. As of March 2019, 59 States and
one member organization—the European Union representing its
28 member States—were Parties to it. Worldwide implementation
of the Agreement, supported by effective monitoring, control
and surveillance, and supplemented by market access and trade
measures, will boost international efforts to curb IUU fishing.
Most countries have frameworks to address the needs
of small-scale fisheries; the next critical stage is their
implementation
Almost all countries have small-scale fisheries, and they account
for more than half of total production in developing countries, both
in terms of quantity and value. Approximately 120 million workers
worldwide—97 per cent of whom live in developing countries—
depend directly on the value chains of commercial capture fisheries
for their livelihoods. Women constitute nearly half of that workforce.
Despite their critical contributions to nutrition, food security and local
livelihoods, many small-scale fishing communities continue to be
marginalized.
To help fisherfolk access productive resources, services and markets,
most countries have developed targeted regulatory and institutional
frameworks. Many countries have implemented those frameworks
to a high degree, but more than one fifth of countries, particularly in
Oceania and Central and Southern Asia, report a low to medium level
of implementation.

Protect, restore and
promote sustainable
use of terrestrial
ecosystems, sustainably
manage forests, combat
desertification, and
halt and reverse land
degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Human activity continues to erode the health of ecosystems on
which all species depend. The loss of forests is slowing but continues
at an alarming rate; one million plant and animal species are at risk
of extinction according to a recent United Nations report, and an
estimated 20 per cent of the Earth’s land area was degraded between
2000 and 2015. Many countries are taking measures to conserve,
restore and make sustainable use of those invaluable natural
resources. They are adopting legal mechanisms to ensure the fair
sharing of benefits from genetic resources, protecting more KBAs,
and implementing sustainable forest management plans. But those
efforts must be scaled up—urgently. The severity of the situation
requires immediate action and a fundamental transformation of
our relationship with the Earth to halt biodiversity loss and protect
ecosystems for the benefit of all.
Land degradation is affecting one fifth of the Earth’s land area and the lives of one billion people
Twenty per cent of the Earth’s total land area was degraded between
2000 and 2015, resulting in a significant loss of services essential
to human well-being. That estimate is relatively conservative given
the underlying sub-indicators, which only represent three variables:
changes in land cover, land productivity and organic carbon in soil. In
all regions, except Europe and Northern America and Northern Africa
and Western Asia, the extent of degradation covered 22.4 per cent
to 35.5 per cent of land area, directly impacting the lives of over
one billion people.
Global trends in land cover indicate a net loss in natural and seminatural classes of land due largely to human-induced processes,
including desertification, deforestation, improper soil management,
cropland expansion and urbanization. Significant declines were also
observed in the productivity of land cover classes that remained
unchanged, with grasslands incurring some of the greatest losses.
Accelerating levels of biodiversity loss demand an emergency response
The loss of global biodiversity is accelerating, moving us closer
towards unknown and irreversible changes to the Earth’s ecosystems.
According to the Red List Index, which tracks data on more than
20,000 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads,
the risk of species extinction has worsened by about 10 per cent
over the last 25 years. The Index declined from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.74
in 2018. Further, the latest report of the Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services noted that
biodiversity is declining faster than at any other time in human history.
The primary drivers of that assault are habitat loss from unsustainable
agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade, climate
change and alien invasive species. But even against such an ominous
backdrop are numerous examples of species recovery following
conservation interventions, including in small island developing States
such as Fiji, Mauritius and the Seychelles. Accelerated action is needed
to safeguard critically endangered species and mainstream extinction
risk reduction across agriculture, industry, trade and other sectors.

Progress in protection of key biodiversity areas must accelerate to meet the 2030 target
Protecting sites that are important for terrestrial, freshwater and
mountain biodiversity—KBAs—is vital to ensuring the long-term
and sustainable use of natural resources. While progress has been
made since 2000 in protecting KBAs, the rate of progress has slowed
significantly since 2010.
The global mean percentage of each terrestrial, freshwater and
mountain KBA covered by protected areas increased by more than 10
percentage points between 2000 and 2010. However, from 2010 to
2018, the coverage only increased by two to three percentage points.
At the current rate, by 2030, less than 50 per cent of each KBA will be
covered by protected areas at the global level, on average.
Mountain ecosystems provide essential environmental services, but their health varies widely among regions
Healthy mountain ecosystems are fundamental to the provision
of ecosystem services to upland communities as well as lowland
peoples living far from mountain peaks. For example, mountains are
the source of 60 to 80 per cent of the world’s freshwater, which is
used for domestic, agricultural and industrial consumption, green
energy production and biodiversity conservation. Green coverage of
mountain areas (by forests, grasslands/shrublands and croplands) is
positively correlated to mountains’ state of health and, consequently,
to their capacity to fulfil their ecosystem roles.
A global baseline of mountain area green coverage has now been
established using 2017 data. That year, 76 per cent of mountain
areas globally were covered with vegetation: in Oceania, almost all
mountain areas were covered, while in Northern Africa and Western
Asia, the share was only 60 per cent.
International agreements are forging innovative
approaches to biodiversity conservation
Countries are making progress in adopting frameworks that
incentivize the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources
and biodiversity through the sharing of benefits. Such resources
include plants, animals, microbes and other genetic material and the
traditional knowledge associated with them.
As of 1 February 2019, the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic
Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising
from their Utilization had been ratified by 116 contracting Parties,
including the European Union (an increase of 65 per cent from 2016).
As of that date, 61 Parties had also adopted access and benefitsharing (ABS) frameworks and published related information in the
ABS Clearing-House (up from 6 in 2016). In addition, 145 Parties
had ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for
Food and Agriculture. As part of the treaty, over 64,000 standard
material transfer agreements have been concluded for the transfer of
more than 4.6 million samples of plant genetic resources for food and
agriculture globally.

Forest area is still declining, but at a slower rate
Between 2000 and 2015, forest area as a share of total land area
decreased from 31.1 to 30.7 per cent. That represents the loss of
more than 58 million hectares of forests, an area roughly the size of
Kenya. Most of that loss occurred in the tropics, with the most sizable
declines found in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Conversion
of forest land for agricultural use, such as growing crops and raising
livestock, is considered a key driver in forest loss.
The loss of forests in some tropical regions is partly balanced out by
an increase in forested land in many parts of Asia, as well as in Europe
and Northern America. In those regions, active afforestation and
landscape restoration, as well as the natural expansion of forests on
abandoned agricultural land, have led to the growth of forested land.
As a result, the net annual rate of forest loss in 2010 to 2015 was
roughly 25 per cent slower than in 2000 to 2005. Moreover, the
proportion of protected forest area and forests under long-term
management plans remained stable or increased in all regions of the
world.

Promote peaceful and
inclusive societies
for sustainable
development, provide
access to justice for
all and build effective,
accountable and
inclusive institutions at all levels
Realizing the goal of peaceful, just and inclusive societies is still a long
way off. In recent years, no substantial advances have been made
towards ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening
institutions at all levels, or increasing access to justice. Millions of
people have been deprived of their security, rights and opportunities,
while attacks on human rights activists and journalists are holding
back development. More countries are ramping up efforts to uncover
human rights abuses and designing laws and regulations that foster
more open and just societies. But much more work is needed to
ensure that these mechanisms are implemented properly.
Conflict and other forms of violence are an affront to sustainable
development. In 2018, the number of people fleeing war, persecution
and conflict exceeded 70 million, the highest level that the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has seen in almost 70 years.
All are particularly vulnerable to various forms of abuse, including
trafficking, violence and non-inclusive decision-making. Ensuring that
they receive adequate protection is paramount to achieving the goal of
inclusive societies and sustainable development.
Young men are at higher risk of murder overall, while most victims of intimate partner homicide are women
The global homicide rate was roughly stable at around 6 per 100,000
people over the 2007–2017 decade, with the highest rates observed
in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of homicide victims
increased by 11 per cent, from 419,000 in 2000 to 464,000 in 2017.
Over that period, lethal violence was increasingly concentrated in two
regions: Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for 34 per cent
of global homicides in 2017 (compared to 27 per cent in 2000), and
the share in sub-Saharan Africa grew from 25 to 33 per cent.
Men made up around 80 per cent of homicide victims overall, but
women constituted the majority (64 per cent) of murder victims
in cases of intimate partner/family-related homicide. For intimate
partner homicides only, the share of female victims was even higher at
82 per cent. Young men 15 to 29 years old faced the highest homicide
risk overall with some regional variations.
The majority of trafficking victims are taken for sexual exploitation and forced labour
In recent years, a growing number of trafficking victims have been
detected in countries around the world: from an average of 150
detected victims per country in 2010 to 254 in 2016. The number of
reporting countries remained roughly the same (93 in 2010 compared
to 97 in 2016). The increase in the average number of detected
victims per country may be a sign of increased efforts by authorities
to identify victims; alternatively, it could reflect a growing trafficking
problem. Contrary to findings from earlier years, most trafficking
victims are now detected domestically.
In 2016, adult women comprised nearly half of the detected victims
globally, and girls accounted for about 23 per cent. The majority of
victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation (about 59 per cent), and
more than a third were trafficked for forced labour. Victim profiles were
different depending on the form of exploitation. While 83 per cent
of the female victims in 2016 were trafficked for sexual exploitation,
82 per cent of the males were trafficked for forced labour.

Birth registration is a human right, yet less than three quarters of children under 5 years of age worldwide are
registered
Birth registration is fundamental to helping people access their
individual rights, such as basic social services and legal justice. Yet,
less than three quarters (73 per cent) of children under 5 years of
age worldwide have had their births registered, according to data
from 161 countries over the period 2010 to 2018. Many countries
and regions have reached universal or near universal coverage, but
in sub-Saharan Africa, fewer than half (46 per cent) of all children
under 5 years of age are registered. Central and Southern Asia and
South-Eastern Asia also lag behind at 68 per cent and 82 per cent,
respectively. Much work has been done recently to improve civil
registration systems and to raise awareness among citizens, but
continued efforts are needed to ensure that all children can claim their
right to an identity.
Murder rates among human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists are rising
From 1 January to 31 October 2018, the United Nations recorded and
verified 397 killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade
unionists in 41 countries. Every week, an average of nine people were
murdered on the front lines of efforts to build more inclusive and
equal societies—a disturbing increase from the average of one victim
per day from 2015 to 2017.
One in two victims had been working with communities on issues
involving land, the environment, poverty, the rights of minorities and
indigenous peoples, or the impact of business activities. And, overall,
every tenth victim was a woman. Journalists and bloggers constituted
one quarter of the total number of victims killed, and most of these
murders occurred outside of countries experiencing conflict.
Unless Member States live up to their international obligation to
protect those who stand up for the fundamental rights and freedoms
of others, human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists will
continue to be targets of assassination in countries around the world.
More countries are establishing legal and institutional frameworks for the defence of human rights, but the
pace of progress is slow
Binding laws and policies giving individuals the right to access
information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125
countries, with at least 31 countries adopting such laws since 2013.
Expert assessments, however, suggest that in many cases, the
legal framework could be improved. Among the 123 countries for
which data on legal frameworks are available, 40 countries do not
have adequate provisions on the right to appeal to an independent
administrative body, which is considered key for the proper
implementation of this right.
The pace of progress in establishing national human rights institutions
(NHRIs) that are in compliance with the principles relating to
the status of national institutions (the Paris Principles) must be
accelerated. In 2018, only 39 per cent of all countries had successfully
achieved compliance; an increase of 3 per cent (7 countries) from
2015. If growth continues at the same rate, by 2030 only around half
of all countries will have compliant NHRIs to ensure that States deliver
on their human rights obligations.

Strengthen the means
of implementation
and revitalize the
Global Partnership
for Sustainable
Development
Support for implementing the SDGs is gaining momentum, but major
challenges remain. A growing share of the global population has
access to the Internet, and a Technology Bank for LDCs has been
established, yet the digital divide persists. Personal remittances are
at an all-time high, but ODA is declining, and private investment
flows are often out of sync with sustainable development. Moreover,
global growth has slowed due to ongoing trade tensions, and some
governments have retreated from multilateral action. With the stakes
so high, strong international cooperation is needed now more than
ever to ensure that countries have the means to achieve the SDGs.
Despite pledges to boost development financing, aid levels are falling
Net ODA totalled $149 billion in 2018, down by 2.7 per cent in real
terms from 2017. The decline was largely due to a reduction in
donor country aid for hosting refugees. Aid for bilateral projects,
programmes and technical assistance, which represents over half of
total net ODA, rose by 1.3 per cent in real terms from 2017 to 2018.
Contributions to multilateral organizations, which represent about one
third of total net ODA, were stable. Humanitarian aid fell by 8 per cent
in real terms.
ODA is the largest source of external financing for LDCs.
Nevertheless, in 2018, less aid went to LDCs and African countries,
where it is needed most. Preliminary figures indicate that bilateral
ODA to LDCs fell by 3 per cent in real terms from 2017, and aid to
Africa fell by 4 per cent. Donor countries are not living up to their
pledge to ramp up development finance, tamping down efforts to
achieve global Goals.
Effective mobilization of domestic resources, including through taxation, is critical to achieving the SDGs
The effective mobilization and use of domestic resources,
underscored by the principle of national ownership, is vital to
achieving the SDGs. Assessing the tax burden—that is, revenue in the
form of taxes—is an important fiscal policy exercise with economic
and social implications. The average overall rate of taxation among the
Group of 20 and other advanced economies was 23 per cent of GDP
in 2017, compared to 18 per cent among developing and emerging
market economies.
On average, in 2017, the share of government expenditure funded by
taxes was 64 per cent among the Group of 20 and other advanced
economies and 61 per cent among emerging market economies.
Globally, the slight reduction in the role of taxes in government
spending—from an average of 64.5 per cent in 2005 to 62.3 per cent
in 2017—may be attributable to a combination of improved revenue
mobilization and public financial management.
A well-functioning revenue mobilization system is a prerequisite for
strong, sustained and inclusive economic development. However,
countries must custom-build the components of such a system and its
overarching fiscal framework.

Financial support for statistics has increased, but is still not sufficient to meet demand created by the SDGs
The demand for high-quality, timely and accessible data for
development planning is increasing. To meet that demand, countries
need to establish a strong national statistical plan that has sufficient
funding and political backing to improve statistical capacity across
the national statistical system. In 2018, 129 countries worldwide had
implemented a national statistical plan, up from 102 in 2017. However,
many countries lacked the necessary funding to do so. In sub-Saharan
Africa, only 23 per cent of plans were fully funded, compared to
94 per cent in Europe and Northern America.
In 2016, countries received support valued at $623 million from
multilateral and bilateral donors for all areas of statistics, up from
$591 million in 2015. Such support increased by almost $400 million
from 2006 to 2016, yet was still insufficient to satisfy data and
statistical demands created by the SDGs. To meet statistical capacitybuilding objectives by 2030, current commitments to statistics—
0.33 per cent of total ODA—need to double.
Personal remittances from migrant workers abroad
are becoming the largest source of external financing
in developing countries
Total global remittances reached $689 billion in 2018, up from
$633 billion in 2017. Remittances to low- and middle-income
countries over that period rose by 9.6 per cent, reaching a record
high of $529 billion in 2018. That was more than three times the
amount of ODA they received in 2018, and was significantly larger
than foreign direct investment (if China is excluded). Remittances to
low- and middle-income countries are projected to reach $550 billion
in 2019, making them the largest source of external financing in these
countries.
However, the benefits of remittances from international migrant
workers are reduced by the high cost of transferring money. In the
first quarter of 2019, the average cost of sending $200 was still high,
at around 7 per cent. That is more than double the SDG target of
3 per cent by 2030. The cost of money transfers was highest across
many African corridors and small islands in the Pacific, at about
10 per cent.
Trade tensions among the world’s largest economies
are reverberating, affecting producers and consumers
worldwide
Decreasing tariffs provide wider access to goods and contribute to a
more open trading system. However, ongoing and increasing trade
tensions among large economies have adversely affected consumers
and producers worldwide and negatively impacted business and
financial markets. Those tensions also cast doubt on the future of a
sound multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization.
In 2017, trade-weighted tariffs decreased to an average of 2.2 per cent
worldwide. Large differences were found at the regional level,
however, reflecting global economic imbalances. The highest tariff
rates in 2017 were applied by sub-Saharan African and LDCs,
averaging 7.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively, of the value of
imported merchandise. Those tariffs were significantly higher than
those applied by high-income countries (1.2 per cent) as well as
developing regions as a whole (3.7 per cent). South-Eastern Asia had
an import tariff rate of 1.7 per cent, indicating the region’s growing
openness to international trade.
More than half the world’s population is online; attention must now be directed to the other half
The Internet can be a gateway to development, and a means of
implementation for many of the SDGs. At the end of 2018, more than
half the world’s population (3.9 billion people) used the Internet—an
important step towards a more inclusive global information society.
Over 80 per cent of people in developed countries were online in 2018
compared to 45 per cent in developing countries, and only 20 per cent
in LDCs.
Access to broadband networks is believed to have a significant impact
on global economic output. An increase of 1 per cent in fixed broadband
penetration—the number of subscriptions per 100 inhabitants—is
associated with a rise of 0.08 per cent in global GDP, on average. The
impact is higher in developed countries than in developing countries.
Globally, growth in fixed broadband subscriptions has been sustained,
with the penetration rate rising from 3.4 per 100 inhabitants in 2005 to
14.1 in 2018.

Global indicator framework for the follow-up and review of the Sustainable Development Goals
The information presented in this report is based on the latest
available data (as of May 2019) on selected indicators in the global
indicator framework1 for the Sustainable Development Goals, which
was developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG
Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) and adopted by the General Assembly on
6 July 2017 (see resolution 71/313, annex). The global indicator
framework is used to review progress at the global level.
The choice of indicators for this report does not represent a
prioritization of targets, since all goals and targets are equally
important. The composition of regions and subregions in this report
is based on United Nations geographical divisions, with some
modifications necessary to create, to the extent possible, groups of
countries for which a meaningful analysis could be carried out.2
Data sources and basis for the analysis
The values for most of the indicators presented in this report
represent regional and/or subregional aggregates. In general, the
figures are weighted averages of country data, using the reference
population as a weight, and calculated from national data compiled
by international agencies, according to their respective mandates and
specialized expertise, from national statistical systems. The national
data compiled by the international agencies are often adjusted for
comparability and, where lacking, are estimated. As decided by the
Statistical Commission and in accordance with Economic and Social
Council resolution 2006/6, estimates used to compile the global
indicators should be produced in full consultation with national
statistical authorities. The criteria and mechanisms for validation by
national statistical authorities are outlined in the report of the IAEGSDGs3 and were endorsed by the Statistical Commission at its fiftieth
session.4
The collaboration between national statistical systems and regional
and international organizations is essential for the effective flow of
internationally comparable data. Such mechanisms can be improved
by strengthening the coordination function of national statistical
offices in national statistical systems.
A database of available global, regional and country data and
metadata for the SDG indicators accompanying this report is
maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division and is available
at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs. Owing to the emergence of new data
and revised methodologies, data series presented in this report may
not be comparable with previous data series.
Although the aggregate figures presented in this report are a
convenient way to track progress, the situation of individual countries
within a given region, and across population groups and geographical
areas within a country, may vary significantly from regional averages.
Presenting aggregate figures for all regions also obscures another
reality: the lack, in many parts of the world, of adequate data to assess
national trends and to inform and monitor the implementation of
development policies.
Investing in data for the full implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals
Quality data are vital for governments, development partners,
international organizations, civil society, the private sector and
the general public to make informed decisions and to ensure an
accurate review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Tracking
progress on the SDGs requires the collection, processing, analysis
and dissemination of an unprecedented amount of data and statistics
at subnational, national, regional and global levels, including those
derived from official statistical systems and from new and innovative
data sources.
Many national statistical systems across the globe face serious
challenges in this regard. As a result, accurate and timely information
about critical aspects of people’s lives is unknown. Numerous
groups and individuals remain “invisible”, and many development
challenges are still poorly understood. In General Assembly resolution
70/1, United Nations Member States recognized the crucial role of
strengthened data collection and capacity-building, and committed
to addressing the gap (para. 57). The Cape Town Global Action
Plan for Sustainable Development Data, endorsed by the Statistical
Commission at its forty-eighth session in 2017, provides a road map
for the modernization and strengthening of statistical systems.
Increased investments in national data and statistical systems and
increased mobilization of international and domestic resources are
imperative to meeting this urgent demand. The Dubai Declaration,
launched at the World Data Forum 2018, calls for increased domestic
and international resources and political commitment to strengthen
data systems. It envisages a demand-driven funding mechanism,
under United Nations membership oversight, that can respond
quickly and efficiently to the priorities of national statistical systems.
New data sources and technologies for data collection and for the
integration of various data sources will need to be explored, including
through partnerships with civil society, the private sector and
academia. The integration of geospatial information and statistical
data will be particularly important for the production of several
indicators.

This report presents data on progress made towards achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals worldwide and by various groups.
The country groupings are based on the geographic regions defined
under the Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (known
as M49)5 of the United Nations Statistics Division. The geographic
regions are shown on the map above. For the purpose of presentation,
some of the M49 regions have been combined.
The use of geographic regions as the basis for country groupings is
a major change from The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2016
and the progress reports on the Millennium Development Goals.
Previously, data were presented for countries in “developed” regions
and countries in “developing” regions, which were further broken
down into geographic subregions. Although there is no established
convention for the designation of “developed” and “developing”
countries or areas in the United Nations system, data for some
indicators in this report are still being presented for developed and

only, and are based on the practice employed by the international
agencies that provided the data.6
In addition, the text and figures present, to the extent possible, data
for least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and
small island developing States, which are country groups requiring
special attention.
